Mabel, episode 34. Reactionary Politics. In which what we consume
consumes us.
Intro:
[BEEP]
ARTIFICIAL VOICE: Subject 7825, section 18, test 2
MABEL: Don’t [BEEP]
MABEL: This is - I feel like it’s a waste of energy. What are we supposed to
look for, anyway?
ANNA: Answers. [PAUSE] He was one of them, wasn't he? Aurora Silver’s
people?
MABEL: I don't know. Must have been. [PAIN NOISES] I told you everything I
knew before - before we...whatever we did, under the hill. I don't know why
the king would - it seemed like he wanted to help us but I don't know. I just
don't.

ANNA: He did help us. He could have blinked us out of existence, and he
didn't. He chose - [SIGHS] Are you okay? You're moving...you look stiff.
MABEL: I'm fine, it's fine. [TO THE HOUSE] Some light would help!
[FIRE RUSHES]
ANNA: Be nice. Both of you.
MABEL: Why? I am not nice, and never will be.
ANNA: You and the house are exactly the same. [STUMBLING NOISE] Hey,
stop. Wait, let me - Mabel, what's wrong?
MABEL: [HISSES] It's nothing! Leave me alone.
[HOUSE ROARING]
ANNA: I'm just trying to - will you wait for me? I'm just trying to help. I'm –
worried about you.
MABEL: [NEAR HYSTERICAL] I don't have to tell you anything! I don't have to
explain [HOUSE SCREAMS, SHIFTS]
ANNA: Hey! What did you – where did it put us? Where are we?
MABEL: [SLIGHTLY FEARFUL] We're in the attic.
ANNA: Oh my god. I - found the letters here. That was. Wait, is it – punishing
us?
MABEL: It's certainly the place for it. Always was. [PAUSE] I know I should be
honest with you.
ANNA: You really don't have to tell me what's wrong. You don't have to do
anything. I just want to help. You know that, right? There's something - I can
tell there's something you're not – [HOUSE NOISES GETTING LOUDER]
Stop! Stop being so dramatic, I'm just trying to tell her MABEL: I'm poisoned.

ANNA: You're – what, how did –
[HOUSE SCREAMING]
MABEL: No [BEEP]
JANET: [SPEAKING MORE QUIETLY, OBVIOUSLY FREAKED OUT] I’m back,
I’m okay. What happened –
I don’t know what happened. There was this big crash, I thought maybe I’d
fallen through – like a storm cellar, or something? But I was just – in a pile of
leaves, only I couldn’t get out and couldn’t get out, they were – like –
drowning me, in my mouth, in my nose, and then –
The house. It. Opened its doors.
I know how that sounds. I swear I’m not legitimately losing it. [LAUGHS
SHAKILY] Hey, listeners, remember how I teamed up with April and Shauna
from Morticia Macabre to check out the old sanatorium on the night of the
dark moon and I was the only one who did not literally piss herself and have
to run back to the car? Just thought I should remind you of – [PAUSES,
DISTRACTED] – happier days –
What is that –
[WALKING, SCRATCHING. JANET GASPS]
Whoa.
There’s –
I’m taking photos. Gonna upload these to Twitter right now, so no matter
what happens – [PHONE CAMERA CLICKS SEVERAL TIMES] – we’re, I’m
standing right inside the front door of the house, right? And, well, the
legends are true, the whole place is completely overrun with ivy and weeds
and mushrooms and moss…my granddad’s a hippie, grows his own
psilocybin in his greenhouse – hey Grandpa Pete, if you’re listening! – and
these mushrooms are fucking rare. They shouldn’t be growing in this country
at all, let alone out of a wall somewhere – but whatever. There’s graffiti, too,

all sorts of weird phrases, something about the hound of the sun, something
about a snake, and guys, one of them says –
- one of them says, Janet Kirk met her own death.
[NOISE]
Hello?
Hel[BEEP]
[SKITTERING, SCRABBLING INSECT NOISES]
ANNA: What - is that - are those crickets? Mabel, what do you mean you're MABEL: They're not - didn't you ever go to church, Saint Anna? Don't you
know - what locusts look like - [DISTRESSED NOISES]
[HOUSE DISTRESS]
ANNA: No, I – stop, I can't – I said stop.
[HOUSE NOISES CEASE, SULLENLY]
ANNA: [TRYING V HARD TO REMAIN REASONABLE] You said. You said
you'd been poisoned. How – what, what happened? Mabel, what can I do?
MABEL: You're not going to be able to do that forever. It's like me. Doesn't
like to listen.
ANNA: Please answer my question.
MABEL: Which question?
ANNA: Any of them, maybe? No, don't. Just tell me what happened.
MABEL: The house provided like it always does. There are multitudes inside
it. [GLITCHING VOICE] Cellular structures leading to hollow ground and
hollow organs. That's what happened.

ANNA: [NOISE OF FRUSTRATION] Imagine I just told you I was poisoned.
What would you do? Would you get mad if I started talking in - in ellipses?
Would you want me to be clear with you, to tell you what the fuck was going
on? Can you answer that?
MABEL: [TALKING OVER HER] Yes, of course I would! I'm answering you the
only way I know how, the only - you are a person, Anna, or you were, once. I
have spent more time in the thicket and the black mud and the cavernous,
rooting hill than anywhere else. What does that make me?
ANNA: Someone incapable of - [DEEP BREATH] You're sick. That's a yes or
no question.
MABEL: That isn't a question at all.
ANNA: Oh my god. You. Are. Sick. Correct?
MABEL: No. I'm not sick. I'm poisoned.
[HOUSE ROARING]
ANNA: I know, I know! I'm doing my best. She's being difficult. [SIGHS]
Mabel. Who poisoned you? With what? Was it - it wasn't the king, he
wouldn't have – I don't think he – was it one of them, the others? The, the
people of the hill? [SHUDDERING SOUNDS] Tell me, you just have to –
MABEL: You have to stop trying to - talk to it, reason with it. Like me, it is
entirely unreasonable.
ANNA: I don't have to do anything. You forgot who I am now.
MABEL: [DISBELIEVING LAUGHTER] Oh, no. I never forget a tyrant.
[BEEP]
ARTIFICIAL VOICE: Subject 6163, section 1, test 4
[STRANGELY WET SOUNDS, TEARING]
[SCREAMING]
[TERRIFYING SINGING]

[BEEP]
ACONITE: I dream about you. Отец, I say in my dreams, though I do not
think this is my native language. Отец, ojciec, tėvas. You plucked me from the
folds and billows of void and made me. Built me. Shaped me. Gave me form
and function. For this, I suppose, I must be grateful.
There is a kind of insect called a mantidfly. Mantispidae, mantis lacewing.
Larvae of the species tuck themselves into the abdominal crevices of adult
female spiders until those spiders lay egg sacs, when the larvae let
themselves be cocooned in the sac so they can devour the baby spiders’
forming bodies inside their own eggs. Here, within the womb built by a
mother spider for her own offspring, the mantidflies slowly, lazily pupate.
Does the mantidfly remember its own birth? How it burrowed and infiltrated
and feasted? I remember you, the great gaping mouth of you, how you
reached inside my chest and placed something there – a piece of coal
compressed into a diamond, a folded paper box. You did not give me my
name. You did not give me my purpose. When you left, you left me nothing
except my inheritance.
I don’t want it for your sake. I want it for mine. If it was your choice to make
me and then discard me, to mold and replace me with that green-eyed etin,
that snake bitch, then it is my choice to take your name and devour it. Take
your rule and devour it. Take your kingdom, and devour it.
[BEEP]
[HOUSE NOISES]
ANNA: It was the bullet, wasn't it. That's why – your arm, it cauterized itself.
That's why it burned. You're allergic to - what are bullets made of? Probably
not lead anymore. Steel?
MABEL: A lot of bullets are made with lead cores, actually. They mushroom
inside people. More flexible that way.
ANNA: Why are you doing this?
MABEL: It's the casing that's steel, sometimes. Anyway.

ANNA: Let me out. [BANGS ON THE WALL] Let me out, I'm – this is
pointless. You don't want to talk about anything. You don't want me to help
you. The house stuck us in here like squabbling toddlers, there are goddamned locusts everywhere, I just – Let. Me. Out.
MABEL: [LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY]
ANNA: Stop. Mabel, stop. [PAUSES] I'm trying to be patient. I'm trying. What
do you need from me? Can you tell me that?
MABEL: There's something unfurling inside me. It doesn't fit. [PAUSES] I do
not know what I need. Maybe just to have you hear me.
ANNA: I always hear you. I hear you when you tell me you're fine even
though you're clearly not, and when you tell me you're poisoned and then
refuse to say anything else about it, and when you pinpoint the smallest,
most microscopic detail of something I said so you don't have to answer any
of my real – [VERY SADLY] Why are there locusts in here, Mabel? The real
reason.
MABEL: It's what I ate when Sally locked me in here to punish me.
ANNA: Did she do that often?
MABEL: A few times. [LAUGHS BITTERLY] I think maybe she thought I would
die. But I'm very stubborn.
ANNA: I know you are. What did you do, when she locked you up? How long
did she keep you here for?
MABEL: Why are you asking me this?
ANNA: Because I want to know. I always want to know everything about you.
Haven't you ever felt like that about anyone? Like even the most banal parts
of them are more interesting than the entire rest of the world?
MABEL: I'm sorry that this is banal. [PAIN NOISES] I don't know how to get
out of here, so. Maybe we should just keep looking for that dead body like
normal people.
ANNA: Literally only you could turn me saying I want to know everything
about you into an insult. You know what? Compared to surviving as a captive

inside the hill for a million years, having an abusive parent figure is banal. It's
vulgar and it's commonplace and I am sorry it happened to you, you
deserved infinitely more wonderful and beautiful things. Stop mining me for
ways to harm yourself.
MABEL: It wasn't banal to me when I was eight! [INSECT NOISES
INCREASING] Nevermind. It doesn't matter. I don't have to tell you about my
boring childhood, nurse. You'll have better luck with your commands back
under the hill.
ANNA: I'm not commanding anything. I don't think your childhood was
boring. I never said what you were telling me was banal, only that Sally’s
behaviour towards you was. You're right about the dead body. It's not in
here. The house will have to let us out if it wants us to get anything done.
MABEL: [WEARILY] Okay. Okay. I’m sorry. Okay.
[HOUSE DISRUPTIONS]
ANNA: [TO THE HOUSE] What do you want this time?
MABEL: Time. Space. Empathy. To eat and eat and eat. I bet it devoured
him. The man with the gun. There's only mushrooms left now.
ANNA: That would solve a few of our problems. [TO THE HOUSE] Hey, if
you're hungry, go for it. I myself am dead and do not eat, but you're a
growing - whatever you are.
MABEL: You know you - you actually do have to eat. Fun fact.
[ALL THE BACKGROUND LOCUST NOISES STOP SUDDENLY AND
SHARPLY]
MABEL: [LONG PAUSE] If you had it to do over, would you taunt the man
with the gun? If he'd pointed it at you, would you have laughed in his face?
ANNA: What could a gun do? There's no skin on my hand and it doesn't
make any difference. I ate poison and died. A gun would just cut another
hole in me, it would just - bloom, like a flower. Blood vessels and organs. Like
you pointed out, I'm a nurse. I could put it all back together.
MABEL: But you can't put me back together.

ANNA: You don't know that. You won't even let me [ROARING HOUSE NOISE. THUD OF A BODY]
Oh my god.
MABEL: [FEARFULLY] Anna.
ANNA: What now?
MABEL: The body is - there's something inside it - please [CHITTERING NOISES]
ANNA: Get back. Don't – [SUDDENLY MUCH COLDER] Mabel, don't move.
Don't move. Look at me, okay?
[CHITTERING SOUND TRANSFORMS INTO HISSING AND A RATTLESNAKE
RATTLE]
MABEL: [BABBLING] It's all coming back, it's all happening again, it's going
to be the same thing over and over they're coming back they're coming back
to do it again [BEEP]
