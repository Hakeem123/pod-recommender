MATRYOSHKA
Mabel, Episode 28: Matryoshka. In which the house eats all whole.
INTRO:
MABEL: You think you are the king of the bog, of the underhill, of the black
wind howling between the stars? You think you are the monster at the end of
this book? She is Saint Anna, Anna with the mouth of god, Anna with the fist
of bone. I am the girl half burning. I am the bull in the maze. I am Mabel
Martin. I am coming for you. I am coming for you. We are coming for you.
[BEEP]
[GLITCHING, DISTORTION]
[MABEL SCREAMING/SOMETHING]
[BEEP]
MABEL: Let me out! You cannot keep [BEEP]
MABEL: - the worst thing. It isn't the most incapacitating thing, it isn't the
thing that will cripple you or kill you. This is just - this is just something that
happened. Something you will deal with and escape from, just like you
always do.

[DISTANT NOISES]
MABEL: Follow the thread.

[MUFFLED TALKING]

[BEEP]

[BEEP]
ANNA: [CLEARLY TRYING VERY HARD TO STAY CALM] I don't know what
you're talking about. I worked for Sally, I was a home carer. There's nothing you know what I am. You of all people - of all things. You should know.
VERATRINE: Oh, Anna, still lying to yourself. But you cannot lie to me. I was
built from the cavern of your head. From the sinuous box of ivy you keep
buried in there. You make yourself smaller than what you are. Is it out of fear?
ANNA: You're not - you're not making any sense. This isn't even - I need to
figure out a way to get her back, not - not wasting my time with whatever this
is! If you can't help me then just VERATRINE: I will help you, Anna Limon. But not because of you. I am
curious to see what Mabel will do when she finds out who you are. I am
curious to see which one of us will tell her first.
ANNA: You don't - you don't know anything. You might look like me, but you don't know what happened, you don't know - you don't know Mabel, I
won't - I won't let you - I won't let you poison her, I'd cut out your tongue
before VERATRINE: Ah. So you already doubt her, then. You think it is possible for
her to be poisoned. Poor Mabel. I wonder if she can feel you tugging at her
scraps in the cold, dark place she's found herself in ANNA: Keep her name out of your mouth. Do you think I'm a liar? Do you
doubt that I'd kill you for her sake a thousand times over? You said you'd
help me. Are you going to? Or am I going to - [DISTORTION] You know.
VERATRINE: Yes, I know. You're very predictable. [SMUGLY] You're hardly
going to hear her if you keep talking. I suggest we listen.

ANNA: Give me a second. [DISTORTION; VERA GRUNTS IN PAIN] Okay.
Listening.
VERATRINE: Now we [BEEP]
UNKNOWN VOICE 1: - won’t be happy. How can we have just UNKNOWN VOICE 2: - lost signal. What about the red line?
UNKNOWN VOICE 1: What?
UNKNOWN VOICE 2: Check the UNKNOWN VOICE 3: I’m telling you, there’s nothing there, it’s all gone, I
don’t know how it’s UNKNOWN VOICE 2: Do you guys mind? Give me a hand with the UNKNOWN VOICE 1: Wait. Can you hear [BEEP]
[MABEL SINGING]
[BREAKS OFF INTO TEARS]
[BEEP]
MABEL: - shapes and forms. If I knock once, if I knock twice, I - no, I’ve
forgotten it all. I don’t remember [TRYING TO KEEP FROM CRYING]
Alright. Alright. Assessment. I have not left. I can hear - I can hear her like the
distant voice of god coming through, oh Anna, I - it’s dark in here. It’s dark
and cramped, it’s worse than before, it’s like - crawling into a gopher hole,
crawling out of a closet you’ve hid in to get away from something terrifying.
Without the comfort of knowing you are hidden and thus, imaginarily safe.

Ranting. There’s nothing here that’s - it’s too smooth. All I can do is keep
walking. You can’t hear me, you can’t - it’s wishful thinking. I can’t devolve
into childish whims. I am cut off from you truly for perhaps the first time.
Sometimes I wonder if this house is Sally’s influence. If she didn’t die at all
but hovered like a great white bird of death above this place, feathers
creeping in at every inconvenience. Mouse, she called me, mouse scurrying
and gnawing. I dreamed of myself as an owl pellet, festering in her dry gut
until she spat me up, the bones of me changed, the bloodless, meatless skin
and hair left, wrapped up like a gift. Have you ever seen an owl pellet?
There’s something sinister about them. No, you’re - I can’t do this, you aren’t
here I can find my out. I was always good at puzzles. I know that I can. I can. I can.
[BEEP]
LUNA: Remember your own birth. Remember what it was like, the violence of
becoming matter when previously you had been only starlight and absence.
Your mother opened her wet red fists and you bled from her fingertips onto
the cold mud of the hillside. Wasn’t it cruel? The colours of the world,
weren’t they frenzied, terrible?
If I had a mother, she must have been something vast, to encompass the
whole of me. I wonder, sometimes, if she mourned me; if she mourns me still.
I have been gone so long perhaps she forgot me, stitched up the wounds I
left when I clawed my way out of her, told strange new stories to explain the
scars. Oh, these? The shifting of continent over continent. This ragged seam?
The continued bursting of the universe at its own constraints. You know how
it is.
I do not believe I will ever forget you.
[STATIC]
VERA: I knew her in the back of my throat. Something I could taste, a
palpable, physical presence. She looked at me and I felt myself come
undone.
Her hair like the light of the moon. Her skin like the night enshrining it. I
wanted to wrap my hands around hers, lying patiently in her lap like quiet
birds. I wanted to know if she could taste herself in my mouth, on my tongue.

She did not speak to me but I knew her. I knew her. In my branches, in the
festering roots at the heart of me, the nest that the birch cage shelters; she
was there, I felt her. Like starlight shining down the tips of my fingers. What is
the full spectrum of that which I could not know? How could I not have
known I carried this like a seed in my gut?
[STATIC]
LUNA: Hear me: I ripped a vine from the wall of the hill to fashion your spine;
I picked feathered champignons from the mud to serve as your red lungs; I
gathered twigs of larch and yew for the many twisting paths of your veins and
arteries. Your eyes were acorns, your tongue a strip of moss, your throat a
circle of bone worn hollow. Into the baby’s breath of your hair I wove a strand
of hers, but still: there is more of me in you than there is Anna Limon, for
blood presides over every birth, even yours. I cut my wrist and bled into your
mouth and watched you writhe and form and grasp and finally, finally,
breathe.
[STATIC]
VERATRINE: Such dangerous assumptions we make. I assumed that Mabel
Martin would think me the purest form of her love, not lesser; I assumed the
power of her mistress could free us all in an instant. I assumed the king had
built me from his heart to act in accordance with his will. All of this, I knew,
and acted in accordance as such; every step a cautious tread towards what
was right.
But now I am not so sure. Those who believe in creators, in gods, they feel
god inside them.
[STATIC]
LUNA: There is danger in intimacy. It is a thing too like hope. I looked down
at you, curled in my arms, and understood your heartbeat to be my own. You
were born of the hillside’s flesh, my will. My blood saw you into being.
[STATIC]
VERA: How much of my own will is hers? And yet I find myself not inclined to
be angry about it, but. Something else. Something warmer, brighter.
[STATIC]

LUNA: You are of me, though you are not me. Is that what it’s like, to be a
mother? Is that what it’s like to be in love?
[BEEP]
ANNA: [DISTANTLY] Who are you talking to?
VERATRINE: [QUIETLY] I suppose I am talking to you. The house, the ghost.
The girl in the mirror. Has it been you all along, the empty space at the heart
of me?
ANNA: …..oh, god. You’re [BEEP]
UNKNOWN VOICE 1: What are we supposed to be UNKNOWN VOICE 2: Just see if you can get the recording of him UNKNOWN VOICE 1: I told you, it’s gone. There’s nothing that can be done
about it now.
UNKNOWN VOICE 3: They’re going to be angry about that. Why don’t we
see if we can get them back online, at least
UNKNOWN VOICE 2: I don’t know how they keep going in and out when the
GPS is [BEEP]
[SOUNDS OF DISTANT RUNNING WATER]
MABEL: Do you think you are clever, changing the landscape? Sally. Sally,
that’s what I’m going to call you, Sally, you pale, limp old wretch, Sally, blueveined and sick, Sally, claw footed and scathing, that is you, you managerial
old [HOUSE MAKING SOUNDS OF VAGUE ANNOYANCES]
Oh, that bothers you, does it? Gaoler to gaoler, prisoner to prisoner? We are
certainly not inmates serving similar sentences. There is no question of that.

[HOUSE MAKING VAGUELY THREATENING NOISES]
MABEL: [LAUGHS] No one is forcing you to behave this way. If you want to
be exempt from my criticism, there is an easy way to do it. Sally. Sally-bird,
sally-bell, sally-salvation - [LAUGHS] I have always found a way outside of this
place, outside of the labyrinth of you, I have planted the seeds of myself
wherever I go, I will tear at you until you decide I am too much trouble, do
you understand? I am too much trouble, I am the suppurating wound in your
thigh ever-burning and I [DISTANT ODD NOISES]
MABEL: What is [RUNNING]
[BEEP]
[FOOTSTEPS SLOWING]
[NOISE GROWING LOUDER; GRADUALLY REVEALED TO BE THE FIRST
THING ANNA EVER SAID: she said I’m going into the ground for you,
GLITCHING AND REPEATING]
MABEL [TALKING OVER IT, BAFFLED]: What the [BEEP]
ANNA: Mabel! Mabel! She can hear me, she can hear - she's right there
behind the wall, I just have to - it's - that's - that's what you're saying, isn't it?
The house, it's - everything means something, all of it is relevant. So if I just [BACKGROUND SOUNDS OF VERA FREAKING OUT MILDLY; UNPLEASANT
TEARING SOUND] It's okay. It's okay, stop screaming. I need to get to her, I
need to get it open [HOUSE HOWLING, SHUDDERING]
VERATRINE: What are you doing, stop tearing yourself apart ANNA: No, it's working! Help me pull -

[GLASS SMASHING. WALLS TEARING. SOUND OF METAL RIPPING
THROUGH METAL]
MABEL: I’m here, I’m here, I’m – Anna, it’s ANNA: I hear her! Vera VERATRINE: [GRIMLY] Yes. Yes.
[RIPPING SOUNDS. THE HOUSE WAILS]
MABEL: Anna, Anna, please, I could hear you but it wasn’t - you’re - why are
you covered - whose blood is that ANNA: It’s all right. It’s nothing, I can’t feel it. Are you hurt? Look at me. Are
you okay?
MABEL: [INCREASINGLY UPSET] You bleeding all over the place isn’t
nothing! What did you tell me, that - I can’t be so cavalier with myself, but
neither can you, don’t - don’t you know how much I care about you, don’t
you know how I can’t stand to see you - you’re bleeding so much, please ANNA: I can’t just - leave it open like this. Can you feel it? The house, it’s there’s nothing on the hill that isn’t alive, that doesn’t exert its own will in
some way or other. Are you sure you’re all right?
MABEL: No, I’m fine, it’s you I’m worried about!
ANNA: Hush.
[HOUSE NOISES GRIND TO A HALT]
ANNA: Does it hurt?
[HOUSE MAKES PETULANT NOISE]
ANNA: I’m sorry, but I had to get Mabel out. You ate her.
[HOUSE SNARLS]
ANNA: Please. Why wouldn’t she want to escape you? You’re the – the
emblem of everything she hated. It’s not like you gave her any choice. You

tried to trap her, more than once; she had matches. What did you think was
going to happen?
[HOUSE SNAPS AND GROWLS]
ANNA: Veratrine? Ignore her. No one likes Veratrine.
VERATRINE: [QUIETLY] Mabel likes me.
MABEL: Anna, what are you doing ANNA: I’ll fix it. I’ll patch you up better than new. I’ll give you cornices and
hardwood floors and newel posts made of carved mahogany and I’ll strip all
the bars off the windows, I’ll scrape every inch of char from your walls myself.
Or do you want the opposite? I’ll give you that, too, if that’s what you’d
prefer, I’ll smash every window and uproot every wall and let the wild and the
moss and the wind and the weeds take over, until you’re green and growing
everywhere. I promise. I promise.
[HOUSE NOISES]
ANNA: Because we need your help.
[BEEP]
ANNA: Inside the hill there is a dream of a house. Beyond the hill is the
house itself; structure over structure, fiction within fiction, and at the center of
it us, you and me. The house is mine, but more than that, more than a
capitalistic or even feudalistic understanding of ownership, the house is - the
skin I wear over my skin. The skeleton beneath my own skeleton. Nothing can
we call our own but death, and that small model of the barren earth which
serves as paste and cover to our bones.
You and I do not exist singly. It would be impossible to contain us into one
thing. We are endlessly multiplied, Mabel upon Mabel, Anna upon Anna,
world without end. You looked at me as though you knew me. Did I know,
the first time I typed your number into my phone, what kind of thread I was
unwinding? The multiplicity of ourselves is intrinsically, impossibly linked.
How could I have ever been anything, without you? How could I have ever
lived in a world so forcibly narrowed? I didn’t want to. I tried to walk away
from it. Every path just brought me closer to you.

I am not good. I am no saint. There are terrible stories in the past tense of
me and only some of them I regret. I was weak and I was brittle and I
doubted you, before I ever knew you. Of all my offences, I think this is the
least forgivable.
You live inside me, the same way I live inside you. A moebius strip, a snake
always swallowing its own tail. Mutually-assured destruction, maybe, or
mutual deification. Mutual consumption. I will be the house that holds every
part of you.
Do you know what the next line is, Mabel? After ‘paste and cover for our
bones’? It goes like this: for God’s sake let us sit upon the ground and tell
sad stories of the death of kings. [LAUGHS] This story will be a lot of things,
but never that.
