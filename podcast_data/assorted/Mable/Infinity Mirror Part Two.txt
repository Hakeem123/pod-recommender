Infinity Mirror: From the Walls
Mabel: Infinity Mirror, Part Two – From the Walls. In which an old thread is
plucked loose.
[Intro:]
BECCA: Dear listeners, this is Becca De La Rosa, co-creator of the Mabel
podcast.
MABEL: And this is the rhizome occasionally known as Mabel Martin.
BECCA: In celebration of our upcoming fifth season, we’re going to be
running a little competition.
MABEL: A big competition.
BECCA: Our biggest competition, actually.
MABEL: We’re going to be offering one of our loyal listeners a chance to stay
overnight in the house that inspired the podcast: an empty mansion built
over the cliffs of the Irish Sea.
BECCA: We’ll pay to fly you over here from anywhere in the world. First class.
MABEL: No entries are necessary. Just keep listening - [GLITCHES]

[BEEP]
[LAUGHTER]
[STATIC]

TRESSA: Pick up, pick up pick up.
[FAINT BEEP]
Hi – Becca? This is, uh, Tressa Davies, could you please call me? When you
get a chance? Thanks, I’m. Thanks.
[WALKING NOISES]
What the fuck –
[WINDOW RATTLING. FOOTSTEPS. DOORS OPENING AND CLOSING;
ANOTHER WINDOW RATTLES. PANICKED BREATHING]
Did they – ? They can’t – They can’t –
[SHOUTING] Hello? Can anyone hear me?
[HOUSE CREAKS, ROARS]
Oh, God. Oh my god. What – what is –
[STATIC FUMBLING]
“Number four: eat an apple. Tell us what you left behind when you came
here.”
This is almost too - [LAUGHS, MILDLY HYSTERICAL] I understand Anna
better, now. It helps, having this – [FUMBLES WITH RECORDER] this thing to
talk to. But there’s no Mabel on the other end in faerieland, there’s just –
I have to believe that two – two podcast creators didn’t ship me over to
Ireland from across the ocean, first fucking class, just to murder me in a
mansion by the sea. Right? There’s plenty of Irish people worth murdering,

right, that’s just a - crazy amount of trouble to go to. I have to believe that,
because I’m not stupid. Except, what does that leave? The windows are – not
painted shut, not locked, they’re just glass fitted into wall, no lines to
separate them or shove my fingers under. Organically, like they grew. Apple
tree growing apples, old seaside house growing eyes - I tried to break one. I
threw a lamp at it. The lamp bounced off and hit me in the shoulder. Which
hurt, thanks. What if I had seriously injured myself, who’s - [LAUGHS] I’m
used to people fussing over me, okay. Being watched all the time, in the way
that disabled people always are, thought of as fragile or like. I don’t know.
Delicate, I guess. Half-real, in the way dolls are.
The front door isn’t locked, either, it’s as though it never had hinges or bolts
at all. Only wood, impossible to pick open with my fingernails. I can’t – I tried
calling Becca, I tried calling my dad, I tried calling the police and the coast
guard and even the American embassy. No one picks up.
[CHAIR PULLING OUT]
They’re good apples. Red and green, crunchy and little and cold when I
touch them.
I’m hungry. What else am I going to do?
[CRUNCHING APPLE]
What do you do inside a story? What do you do when - I don’t have a script,
it’s just me, trying to follow the trail of I left behind –
My dad. I live with him. He drives trains, he’s not home much. My cats,
Amadeus and Parmesan, but I left them with Mrs. Elder down the hall, she
spoils them more than I do. The tree in the courtyard, the poplar tree. Uh,
less than half of a college degree. My – my books. My notebooks. The doll
my mother gave me. [PAUSE] It doesn’t sound like much.
Can you –
[CHAIR SCRAPING BACK]
Where –

[SOUND GROWING GRADUALLY LOUDER: SINGING, DISTANT AND
DISTORTED. FOOTSTEPS, SHUFFLING]
Hold on, that can’t be right.
[FOOTSTEPS. GRADUAL BLURRING IN AND OUT OF SINGING VOICES]
It has to be coming from – there’s no room on the other side of this, it has to
be –
It’s coming from the walls.
[LAUGHS, BUILDING UP]
Okay. Okay. I get it. It’s some kind of game, right? A test? Maybe there was
something in the water I drank or - I don’t know. Maybe I’m wrong. I said I
didn’t have a script and I don’t but I do have directions, don’t I? Questions to
be answered? It’s easier when this kind of happening comes with instructions.
A path laid out. I read enough fairytales as a kid to know that. To know not to
- I don’t know, deviate. I know about how to bend the rules without breaking
them. How to - throw away that wine that will put me to sleep. I ate those
berries, didn’t I? [LAUGHS] That’s why you picked me, isn’t it? What other
kind of person listens to this show?
This house really is beautiful. I had a dollhouse like this once, big high
Georgian ceilings and Persian carpets and bay windows. It belonged to –
some friend of my mother’s, I don’t remember. I used to try to shrink myself
in my mind, to project myself inside it. What’s it like, only to look at beautiful
things all day long? Does it make you a better person? Is that what goodness
is, a luxury? In the story Sally isn’t good, she’s weak and bitter and cruel to
Mabel, even when Mabel was just a kid. This house belonged to Becca’s
grandmother. Was she good? Was she – it’s crazy to say “was she Sally”,
but…Was she? There’s a typewriter in this house that knows a secret story I
never told anyone, least of all two podcasters from a different continent. How
much of the story is –
Whatever.
“Number five: remember the mourning dove.”
[AS THOUGH BAFFLED] Remember the –

Oh, no. No, no, no, I didn’t –
[SHOUTS] Are you listening to this? Are you watching me? Is this a game, am
I – am I an experiment, are you – who did you talk to? Did you – did you hack
me, did you – break in and read my fucking –
[QUIETER, MORE APPALLED] I didn’t tell anyone.
[NOISES IN THE DISTANCE]
Wait. Wait. Who is - what are you [STATIC]
