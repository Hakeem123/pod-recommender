Mabel, episode 36: Rendering. In which many echoes reverberate.
[INTRO]
[BEEP]
ANNA: - coronation?
MABEL: Your name. The place that will define you, that you will define - I
thought you knew that?
ANNA: How - would I know that? What - what even is MABEL: You knocked him off his throne. Or: I did. [LAUGHS] By your hand.
The extension of your will, the death knell. In his absence there is a vacuum.
Don't you know that saying? Don't you know that they are nature, wildness
uncontained?
ANNA: I - don't know anything. I don't. I'm not - you're the only one who
knows. I'm just. Muddling along.
MABEL: You saved me pretty well. Clever girl. Sweet harbinger. I think you
know more than you give yourself credit for.

ANNA: I should have done more. I shouldn't have – argued with you. [SIGHS]
You've lived here for years. Tell me about the coronation, then. Is there –
what do we have to do?
MABEL: I don't know the specifics. It's - it isn't a single fit. Different shoes,
different....perspectives. There's no particular way to know that it will be the
same for you as it was for him, and to be frank it's not as though I was there
when he was...crowned. Or caged. I don't know that there's a difference,
anymore. Definition is limitation.
ANNA: So you can't give me a script and tell me where to stand and what to
sign, I guess.
MABEL: Is that my role, now?
ANNA: Not your role. It just would have been handy.
MABEL: Your desires will influence the hill, and seep out into the land
surrounding it. Past your desires, what else does it know? Do you want this to
be handy? Easy? It will bend to your whims like a switch from a willow.
ANNA: And what about you?
MABEL: I cannot be influenced. Is that what you're asking?
ANNA: No. Maybe. Will you be there, with me? Will the hill bend to you,
too?
MABEL: Not in such a way. I'm....we're different. The hill, the land, the house
- it will never recognize me as its master. Or as anyone's master. I am too.....I
don't know. [LAUGHS] I think it loves me too much. We are similarly wild. But
I'll always be there with you. There isn't anything that could change that.
ANNA: You were planning on dying without even giving me a chance to save
you.
MABEL: No. I wasn't, I just - I didn't know. I wasn't planning on dying, I just
thought there was no way to stop it. That it was...deserved. Vengeance for
everything I've done. It wasn't about giving you a chance. I'm too selfish to
not want to spare you, Anna. From anything like affliction.

ANNA: Love is an affliction. That's what you told Luna. Love is a leash that
pulls both ways. [PAUSE] I know you thought – what you thought. I hate that
you thought it alone. I only ever want to be with you, in every way. In
everything. Are you ready? To go back?
MABEL: Yes. [PAUSES] I'm....I am sorry, Anna. I'm sorry that I pushed you
away when you were worried about me. This is a new sentiment for me, the
uncomplicated kindness of genuine concern. I am unused to it. I will try not
to - distance myself in that way again.
ANNA: You don't have to apologise. You don't, really. I just need you to
know. Come here. [HOUSE ROARING / MORPHING NOISES]
[BEEP]
ARTIFICIAL VOICE: Subject 5712, section 3, test 5
[ELECTRICITY SPARKING]
UNKNOWN VOICE: [HOLLOWLY] It’s really you. I missed you so much. It’s
really you. I miss you so much. It’s really you. I missed [BEEP]
[UNDER-THE-HILL SFX. RUNNING WATER, FOOTSTEPS, DISTANT MUSIC]
ANNA: What if I refused?
MABEL: Refused - all of it, the title, kingship, dominion? Then. Well, then.
The hill might curl back on itself in a way I am not familiar with.
ANNA: Why didn't he refuse? Was it because of - what you said, the
vacuum? A sense of duty to the proper order of things? Did his allegiance lie
down here? Does he have allegiances?
MABEL: I - I know him better now, at least, than I did before but I still can't there's an inescapable shadow laid over all of his actions, do you feel it? Like
looking at a eclipse through smoked glass. I don't know why he did what he
did, still. I don't think he felt - duty.
ANNA: Do you still think he's a tyrant?

MABEL: Yes. In the same way that we all are.
[BEEP]
ACONITE: I was born in the dank tannic underworld of the peat bogs. A rope
of braided leather hung looped around my neck, to remind me of my station.
A cape of sheepskin swung over my bony shoulders. I cured for two slow
centuries until my skin was hard and dark and sunken, until my organs,
pickled in the curative peatland brine, were small ossified things, like
petrified wood washed up on a shoreline. My handmaiden was the woman
who washed my body and offered me, kindly, tenderly, to the seeping water,
the waiting mother-of-all. My steward was the man who slit my throat.
I woke from the bog into a place of dimensionless angles, a place of florid
greenery and shimmering darkness, a place of drumbeats, music, wine and
lamplight. I walked its many tunnels until I found another creature: a woman
with wings made of some iridescent membrane, with eyes glittering black
and blue and black. I asked her, am I in the mother’s kingdom? She laughed
at me. She said, you will not find your mother here.
She was right. I did not find her, seed-keeper, lake-dweller, loving tender of
the oat-field. Instead I found him. Sitting on a throne made of midnight, his
crown formed from planes of golden light, like refractions caught in a vast
splintered mirror. He did not acknowledge me. He did not call my name or
bend his head. Beside him, his tame hare ate from a bowl of bloodied hearts.
Do you think that one of them was mine, Anna?
[BEEP]
ARTIFICIAL VOICE: Subject 7825, section 11, test 8
[WEIRD STATIC]
MABEL: [WHISPERS SOMETHING OVER AND OVER]
CULT MEMBER: Make sure this is being transcribed.
MABEL: [CONTINUES]
AURORA SILVER: What is she -? [ANNOYED] Oh, I'll do it [REPEATING PHRASE BECOMES LOUDER BUT STILL INDECIPHERABLE]

AURORA SILVER: Listen [PHRASE BECOMES CLEAR SUDDENLY]
MABEL: [STATIC RECORDING, THE EXACT SAME RECORDING OVER AND
OVER] Hi, you've reached Mabel Martin, I can't pick up the phone right now
so
AURORA SILVER: [SCREAMS]
MABEL: [RECORDING LAYERS ON TOP OF ITSELF UNTIL UNINTELLIGIBLE]
[STATIC]
[BEEP]
ANNA: How is your arm? Does it hurt, still?
MABEL: It twinges. Probably not as much as it should. [PAUSES] It's - I don't
understand why we aren't being interrupted.
ANNA: Who should be interrupting us?
MABEL: The hill. The - them. They should be doing something. It feels like
trespassing. Some kind of ..tin and citrus on the air. Hedge crossing.
ANNA: Maybe they're being. Considerate.
MABEL: Polite. That's. It's apt. There's a strange courtliness to everything
they do, even when it's bleeding. [PAUSES] Everything we do.
ANNA: You can't exactly deny you're one of them now. You almost died
from coming in contact with a small amount of iron. That's not –
MABEL: I know. But I meant. Both of us. [PAUSES] I never tried to deny it. I
always had several roots to pull up when the well ran dry.
ANNA: Half in, half out. I wasn't like that. Not for the last – however many
years, anyway. [STRANGE SOUND IN THE DISTANCE] What are they doing?
MABEL: Preparing.

ANNA: For – ? Oh.
MABEL: What are you going to do?
ANNA: What's the right thing? I don't know. I feel - something. Does it
always watch? The Hill. Are we never alone?
MABEL: It watches the way the girl who lives inside the cave of your skull
watches. Informed by intuition, by cultural context, by the myth of the fixed
personality, she too is always peering out into you. So, yes. Like the roots of
a tree watch for water. Like a kudzu vine watches for room to grow. You were
never alone, anyway, Anna Limon. Isn't that true?
ANNA: Not in the beginning. Later I was alone. [PAUSE] Would we be
together? If all this was different. Would you even think I was interesting? Are
we together, in every version?
MABEL: Yes. Nothing you do could ever be mundane. [PAUSES] You really
don't know what you look like do you? [DREAMILY] A field of red poppies. A
sky full of gold and gore. The blackest part of the sweet ocean. Inscrutable.
Inexplicable.
ANNA: Then say I'm just. A person. That's it, that's all. I'm a woman without a
hand made of bone and I meet you in your – I don't know. Your flower shop.
What do you say to me? What do we talk about?
MABEL: Flowers, obviously. Don't we always?
[BACKGROUND SLOWLY MORPHS TO AVERAGE NOISE; PEOPLE
TALKING, REGISTER SOUNDS, ETC.]
MABEL: [SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VOICE] "That bouquet suits you. Or would
you rather pick your own? Some people like that."
ANNA: [SAME] "The only thing I know about flowers is that roses smell like
my abuelita. What would you recommend?"
MABEL: "For you? Let's see. Pink rosebud mouth, black orchid hair. Peony
skin. Maybe some thistles - for a sense of danger?"

ANNA: "Oh, you think I'm dangerous. Okay, this isn't fair. Let me pick for
you. This white one – "
MABEL: “Hyacinth.”
ANNA: " - because it looks like it keeps secrets. This spiky looking one – "
MABEL: "That's actually another kind of orchid. Spider orchid."
ANNA: "Spider orchid? I like that. That one because it's out of the ordinary.
And some of that green stuff – "
MABEL: "Oh, come on. You know what Spanish moss is. I'm sure you've used
some on unsuspecting individuals."
ANNA: "Accusing your customers of witchcraft is a bold move. Fine, Spanish
moss. Because it matches your eyes. How did I do?"
MABEL: "I think very well. Near flattering. But perhaps it merits further
discussion."
ANNA: "I was going to say the same thing. I don't have time for florist
school, unfortunately, maybe you could give me a crash course. Do you drink
coffee?"
MABEL: "No, but I'll watch you drink it if you don't mind my hot chocolate."
ANNA: "I could have guessed that you'd only like sweet things. What else
makes sense for a girl who works in a shop full of flowers?"
MABEL: "Perhaps I am secretly poisonous."
ANNA: "If it's a secret, you shouldn't tell me."
MABEL: "Shouldn't I?"
ANNA: "You think it's in my best interest to know if you're poisonous or not?
Why would that be?"
MABEL: "Well, you really should be careful of what you eat -"

[SEMI GROTESQUE PLANT GROWING SOUNDS; REAL-WORLD NOISES
FADE ABRUPTLY BACK TO THE NOISES OF THE HILL]
ANNA: [NORMAL VOICE] Was that wall - always there?
MABEL: [SADLY, WEARILY] No. It wasn't. The hill is shifting towards our
presence. Or against it, I'm not sure.
ANNA: Why would it – never mind. I guess we should - do. Something.
MABEL: I'll follow where you lead.
ANNA: [SLIGHTLY DESPERATE] I just wanted [BEEP]
ACONITE: I was born in the apocalyptic tumult of the Black Death, the ratborne plague that ravaged Eurasia from Kazan to Fez. I grew red boils under
my arms and between my legs; I vomited blood; I swam through fever; but
though I did not die, all those in my household did, and they had locked and
barred our doors from the outside and painted the lintel with a red cross, and
so I slowly starved to death, surrounded by the slowly rotting dead. On what
I knew well to be my last day, I saw a long-limbed spider descend from the
eaves. It cast no shadow; its footsteps minced, one over another over
another over another, delicate and curiously articulated. It said: come.
I rose and followed. I had grown thin enough to slip in between the spaces in
the floorboards, and the spider’s thorax glowed with underwater light, and
he brought me to –
[AS THOUGH GROWING SLIGHTLY UPSET] I was born in the crossing to the
New World, when the ship tossed and bucked and threw me into the cabin
wall and I cracked my skull and sickened in the filthy, cramped quarters given
to us and from the depths of the lashing black ocean I saw a mouth opening
forever and it said – and my father –
[IS SHE ANGRY? DESPERATE? SHE SHIFTS AND TWISTS ON HERSELF] I was
born – I –
I was born. I was. I am. I dig, I breathe, I drink, I dream. I wait, and wait, and
wait. Until I do not wait. Until I rise, and bring with me the fury of the black
earth, the poison of the waiting pitch, until I say –

– I was born to take my father’s throne from you, Anna –
[BEEP]
[WATER NOISES]
MABEL: It's cold down here. Damp. Everything grows in crevices. [PAUSES,
AT LENGTH] Sometimes I wish it were different. But only sometimes.
ANNA: Different like a flower shop somewhere in the village?
MABEL: Yes. And no. There is no world in which I am uncomplicated and
serene. [PAUSES] I would apologize but I know you don't want me to.
ANNA: I don't want a version of you that's different than what you are. I only
ever wanted you. There is nothing you should be sorry about. I'm just sorry I
can't – change any of this. Not fundamentally. I can change shapes but not elements. I would give you everything you want, if –
MABEL: You do. You will. We both will. That's all I want, really. For both of us
to be united against every possible universe.
ANNA: [ONLY VERY SLIGHTLY SADLY] Then take my hand, and tell me
you're with me.
MABEL: I'm with you. Always.
[BEEP]
JANET: -lo?
[SINGING, DISTANT]
Well, that’s creepy.
This is all creepy. I would say I’m being punked, except – this wasn’t a
planned trip, not like to the prison, right? I didn’t tell anyone I was coming
here, not even –
[STRANGE HOUSE NOISES]

[JANET CLEARLY BEGINS TO FEEL DEEPLY UNEASY] Rule number one of
paranormal investigation, kids. Always tell someone where you’re going. Not
because of demons or ghosts or anything like that, but because – you never
know what might happen.
ECHO: You never know what might happen.
JANET: What the fuck? [CALLING] Hello?
ECHO: Hello? Hello?
JANET: That’s it. Sorry, guys, time to get out of here.
[HURRIED FOOTSTEPS. DOOR RATTLING.]
JANET: Why – I was just –
[MORE RATTLING. KICKING, BANGING.]
JANET: Let me out! Let me out, let me –
ECHO: [DREAMILY] Let me out. Let me out. Let me out. Let me –
