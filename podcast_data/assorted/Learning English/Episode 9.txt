Title: “Stress Checked”
Summary:

Vanessa and Michael discuss about different ways to deal with stress.
In this radio broadcast, Vanessa, Michael, Alexander & Denise are in the middle of a
live show in a radio studio. Listen to their conversation and answer the question that
follows about the main idea.
Vanessa:

Hello and welcome to our program! Today we’re talking about stress.
Are you too busy to take the weekend off? Are you feeling worn
out? What makes you feel stressed and what do you do about it?
Personally, having to do things alone can be really stressful for me. I
just can’t stand being alone. What about you Michael?

Michael:

Do you want to know what I do when I feel stressed? I have a long
hot bath; listen to some soothing music, light candles, read poetry. I
find all these very relaxing. But actually, I have to confess that for
me feeling stressed can be pretty productive. It pushes me to do
things! And I must say that I get annoyed by people who go to
pieces when they’re stressed; I tend to avoid working with these
people.

Vanessa:

Denise Crane, our resident psychologist is now in the studio with us.
But let’s first hear from our reporter Alexander. Alexander, what
makes you stressed?

Alexander:

Hi Vanessa. Well, routine or not having the time to do something
creative can drive me crazy. And I have to say, if I’m really stressed
I sort of pretend to be somebody else, in order to get me through
the moment. You know someone tough. And afterwards, I like to

go for a long walk, just to get back in touch with myself. I’ve found
that’s really therapeutic.

Vanessa:

Interesting answers Denise, don't you think?

Denise:

Oh, absolutely!

Vanessa:

You know . . . what really stresses ME out is when my mum asks me
when I'm going to get married.

Denise:

What do you do about it?

Vanessa:

You mean apart from feeling hopeless, helpless or worthless for some
time?

Denise:

(Laughing) well yeah, if possible.

Vanessa:

Erm, if I'm really stressed out I ride my bike for a couple of hours, or
go kick boxing; physical exercise helps me let off steam.
But let's hear from you Denise. . .

Now answer the following question…

What are Vanessa, Nick, Michael, & Lisa talking about?
They’re talking about what makes them feel stressed and what they do about it.

Now listen again to the extract in parts. After each part there will be 3 to 4 questions
on the details…
Part 1
Vanessa:

Hello and welcome to our program! Today we’re talking about stress.
Are you too busy to take the weekend off? Are you feeling worn
out? What makes you feel stressed and what do you do about it?
Personally, having to do things alone can be really stressful for me. I
just can’t stand being alone. What about you Michael?

Michael:

Do you want to know what I do when I feel stressed? I have a long
hot bath; listen to some soothing music, light candles, read poetry. I
find all these very relaxing. But actually, I have to confess that for
me feeling stressed can be pretty productive. It pushes me to do
things! And I must say that I get annoyed by people who go to
pieces when they’re stressed; I tend to avoid working with these
people.

Vanessa:

Denise Crane, our resident psychologist is now in the studio with us.
But let’s hear first from our reporter Alexander. Alexander, what
makes you stressed?

Now answer some questions . . .
1. Vanessa says: “Are you too busy to take the weekend off?” What does
this phrase mean?
When you are ‘too busy’ you have a lot of things to do so you don’t have free
time. When you ‘take the weekend off’ you take holiday from work for a
weekend. So Vanessa asks the listeners: ‘Do you have so much work to do
that you cannot even take a break from work for a weekend?’
2. Vanessa says: “Are you feeling worn out?” What does ‘worn out’ mean?
When you feel ‘worn out’ you’re ‘too tired’. It is the past tense form of ‘wear
out’.
3. Vanessa says: “I just can’t stand being alone”.
What does ‘I can’t stand’ mean?
‘I can’t stand’ means ‘I hate’ and is an expression that is always followed by
an –ing verb form or a noun.
4. Michael says: “I get annoyed by people who go to pieces when they are
stressed”. What does ‘go to pieces’ mean?

‘Go to pieces’ means lose control.

Now listen to the second part of the dialogue.
Part 2
Alexander:

Hi Vanessa. Well, routine or not having the time to do something
creative can drive me crazy. And I have to say, if I’m really stressed
I sort of pretend to be somebody else, in order to get me through
the moment. You know someone tough. And afterwards, I like to
go for a long walk, just to get back in touch with myself. I’ve found
that’s really therapeutic.

Vanessa:

Denise:

Vanessa:

when I'm going to get married.

Denise:

Vanessa:

time?

Denise:

(Laughing) well yeah, if possible.

Vanessa:

Erm, if I'm really stressed out I ride my bike for a couple of hours, or
go kick boxing; physical exercise helps me let off steam.
But let's hear from you Denise. . .

Now answer some questions….
1. Alexander says: “Routine or not having the time to do something creative
can drive me crazy.” What does ‘drive me crazy’ mean?
If something or someone ‘can drive you crazy’ they make you feel really
upset.
2. Alexander says: “. . . if I’m really stressed I sort of pretend to be somebody
else, in order to get me through the moment.”
What does ‘get me through the moment’ mean?
‘Get me through the moment’ means help me survive the experience. So
Alexander means that pretending to be someone else helps him survive when
he is under stress.
3. Alexander says: “I’ve found that’s really therapeutic!” What does
‘therapeutic’ mean?

If something you do is ‘therapeutic’ it means that it is ‘helpful’.
4. Vanessa says “physical exercise helps me let off steam” What does “let off
steam” mean?
To “let off steam” means to let your anger or aggression out.
