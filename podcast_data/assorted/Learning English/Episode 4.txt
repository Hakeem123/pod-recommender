Vanessa:

In tonight’s show Lisa and I will be reporting on the history of Harley
Davidson’s. So Lisa, could you tell our listeners how Harley’s started?

Lisa:

Well, many people believe it was a family business but it wasn’t!

Vanessa:

What do you mean it wasn’t? Wasn’t it Arthur and Walter Davidson’s
idea?

Lisa:

No, not really. Do you really wanna know how it got started? …

Vanessa:

Lisa:

Yeah, fill us in.

It all started in 1901 when Arthur Davidson and his friend William
Harley were experimenting on their motor-bicycle. Harley, who was
studying to be a mechanic, had drawn up plans for a small engine
that would be used in a regular pedal-bicycle frame.

I see. But when did Walter Davidson come into the picture?

Lisa:

Walter came in two years later when he helped them finish off
building their first bike.

Vanessa:

So you’re saying it took them only five years to build their first
factory!

That’s mostly because they were absolutely mad about bikes, and
their aim was to make a bike that would be extraordinary.

And they certainly managed to do so!
