Alex and Denise are at the hairdresser’s. Listen to their conversation and answer the
question that follows about the main idea.
Dialogue:
Stylist:

Hi, how can we help you today?

Alex:

Yeah I’d like to get my hair trimmed a little, nothing fancy,
just a basic trim, and my friend here…

Denise:

Hi yeah, I’d like something less conventional; I was
thinking of bangs and…layered?

Stylist:

Okay, well if you’d just like to go with Alicia here, she’ll help
you out. And you sir, can I interest you in this weeks special?

Alex:

Uh na.

Stylist:

Well, I’ll shampoo, cut and style your hair for one
unbelievable low price of 9.99? Plus I’ll give you a clean shave?

Alex:

Er, no.

Stylist:

Best service in town? And your friend will be a while.

Alex:

Well, okay, I’ll have the complete service today, but as I said
before, I just want to get my hair trimmed, a little off the top,
and the sides, but that’s all, I mean that’s all.

Stylist:

Okay, sit back and relax. Could you take your glasses off? So,
what do you do for living?

Alex:

I’m a lawyer, I specialize in accidents in the work place, and
I’ve got a very important job interview tomorrow.

Stylist:

You seem to have a few grey hairs around over the ears, sir,
would you like me to use some hair coloring?

Alex:

No, no, I kinda like that. My friends say it makes me look
distinguished.

Stylist:

Oops,

Alex:

What do you mean oops, hey, can I see a mirror?

Stylist:

Nothing to worry about sir, relax, I’m just making some
adjustments to the..er…hair trimmer, there we are,
okay…Okay now a wash…here’s the shampoo.

Alex:

Hey you got it in my eyes, I can’t see, where’s the towel?

Stylist:

Relax almost finished, now lets dry your hair….put a little
styling gel in it, and now I’ll style it with the blow dryer…and
brush…and voila! Oh and here’s your friend…

Alex:

Oh hi Denise, Wow! You look great.

Denise:

Do you really like it? I think it’s a bit over the top!

Alex:

No way!!! I love the highlights, they look so natural.
And did you also get it layered?

Denise:

Yes, what do you think? I’m not convinced.

Alex:

Really nice. What about mine?

Denise:

Wellllll…..

Alex:

What?…. What?….WHAT?! Where are my glasses?
Oh…my…god. What have you done!

Now answer the following question…
Are Alex and Denise pleased with their haircuts?
Not really. Something’s obviously wrong with Alex’s and Denise is not sure about
hers.
