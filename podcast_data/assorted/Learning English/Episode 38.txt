In this episode of World Report Vanessa and Nick are in the middle of a live show in a radio studio.
Listen to their conversation and answer the question that follows about the main idea.
Dialogue:
Vanessa:

Beam me up Scotty – I mean, Nick, and download some video game info on
me.

Nick:

Star Trek was an excellent sci-fi series Vanessa but these days video games
are a far cry from the golden oldies: from a techno-logical point of view of
course.

Vanessa:

Well my two nephews would definitely be amongst the top proponents of
video games.

Nick:.

This nouveau silicon sensation has taken young and old by storm
Vanessa. It’s a win-win situation, from the game designers’ perspective;
once you start you can’t stop; and it’s got manufacturers laughing all the
way to the bank.

Vanessa:

As entertaining as it may be, it obviously lacks any substance though.

Nick:

Well, yes, but you know, a recent study shows that today’s kid’s attention
span is increasing due to the amount of time they spend in front of the
screen. Also, their spatial coordination abilities are enhanced by all these
games. And in fact, these games are meant to be a safe way of releasing
pent up aggression.

Vanessa:

I find this really hard to believe.

Nick:.

Yeah, as far as I’m concerned, sitting in front of a computer screen hours
upon end really eliminates many other healthy alternatives like going out
with friends, reading a book, playing sports etc.

Vanessa:

I just think that kids spend too much time on these things.

Nick:

All things in moderation would be an appropriate note to sign off on
Vanessa.

Vanessa:

Over and out!

Talk to you tomorrow.
