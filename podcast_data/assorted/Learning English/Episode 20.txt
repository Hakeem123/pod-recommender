Vanessa:

Was there a ceremony back then?

Nick:

Yes! And it was held at a hotel in Hollywood. And, even though it
wasn’t so important back in those days, it was still pretty glamorous.

Vanessa:

In Hollywood, of course. Where the action is, where else!

Alexander:

How many people attended the ceremony, Nick?

Nick:

More than 270 and the tickets for guests cost $5.

Vanessa:

Wow, that’s a lot of people considering it was the year the Great
Depression started.

Alexander:

Right! The great depression started in 1929; I’d never made the
connection before! Anyway … was it as full of suspense as it is now?

Nick:

No, not really.

Vanessa:

What do you mean Nick?

Nick:

Well, the winners were known before the big night. You see the
results had been given to the newspapers in advance!

Alexander:

So the results were not sealed in an envelope..?

Nick:

No, no. They started that the next year.

Vanessa:

Was it popular in the beginning?

Nick:

You bet. In the second year enthusiasm for the Awards was so
high that an L.A. radio station covered the ceremony live.

Now they’re on TV, with millions of people watching from all over the
world. And the paparazzi sharks and tabloid reporters get fodder for
their papers the next day.
