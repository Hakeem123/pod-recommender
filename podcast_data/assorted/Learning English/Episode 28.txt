Lisa:

Oh, don’t be so melodramatic!!! If this guy’s as good as they say he’ll
take all the proper precautionary measures so there’ll be no
problem.

Alexander:

Did you make sure that a sterile needle is used for each client?

Lisa:

Yes, the piercer allowed me to check everything out, so I’m not
worried! To tell you the truth, it’s the pain that worries me a little.

Alexander:

A little? Have you forgotten how low your pain threshold is?
Remember how you squealed when you had your ears pierced?

Lisa:

Do I ever! Maybe I’ll just stick to the ears!

Alexander:

Sigh…!

Lisa:

Dead serious! I’ve asked around and checked out a few piercing

Alexander:

I think it’s gross!

Lisa:

Well, anyway, I think I’ve got a professional piercer who’s clean and
safe…

Now get ready to answer some questions…

also known as navel.

What does she mean?
She wants Alexander to be supportive of her.
3. Alexander says, “I think, it’s gross!” What does he mean?

bacteria which produce pus. ‘Pus’ is thick yellowish liquid that forms in and comes
from an infected cut or injury in the body.
2. Lisa says, “He’ll take all the proper precautionary measures …”
What are precautionary measures?
Steps you take in order to avoid something bad from happening.
3. Alexander says, “Did you make sure that a sterile needle is used…”
What kind of needle is sterile?
A sterile needle is one that has been disinfected and is free of germs.
