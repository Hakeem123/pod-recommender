Title: “Hydropolis”
Summary:

Vanessa and Nick talk about Hydropilis, a unique underwater luxury hotel.
In this broadcast Vanessa and Nick are in the middle of a live show. Listen to their
conversation and answer the question that follows about the main idea.
Dialogue:
Vanessa:

Good morning everyone. Now throughout history there’ve been
visions of colonizing the sea - Jules Verne was my favorite - but no
one has ever managed to realize this dream. Until now, that is.
Nick is with me to tell us about Hydropolis, the first underwater hotel
to be built ever. Nick, tell us more about this latest craze.

Nick:

Thanks, Vanessa, well as you said; Hydropolis is the world’s first
luxury underwater hotel. It will offer 220 bubble-shaped suites, with
clear glass comprising both the sleeping areas' walls and each room's
bathtub. There’s also going to be two magnificent translucent domes,
which will house a concert hall and a ballroom.

Vanessa:

That’s incredible; it must’ve cost an arm and a leg. Do you
happen to know how long it took them to build?

Nick:

Well, it’s not quite ready yet. They started building it in 2005, and it
will be finished by December 2007. And the price tag? 550 million
dollars!

Vanessa:

Wow, and will it really be underwater?

Nick:

Yeap that’s right. It sits on the Persian Gulf floor, 20 meters below the
surface and covers about 260 hectares, that’s about the size of
London’s Hyde Park.

Vanessa:

That’s unbelievable, Nick, I’m dying to hear more.

Nick:

Well, Hydropolis will include 4 areas; the land station where guests
will enter, then the connecting tunnel, the rooms and then the
entertainment area. And they are expecting around 3,000 visitors per
day in addition to the hotel guests. Their aim is to inspire people to
develop a new awareness of the sea.

Vanessa:

It sounds awesome. How will guests get to the Hotel by submarine?

Nick:

Actually not. It may sound strange but they’ll travel to the main area
by underground train.

Vanessa:

Okay… and now let’s get to the big question. How much is it for a
night?

Nick:

It could be as much as $5,500 for a day's lodging. But hey, what a
place to relax and learn about the world underwater!?

Vanessa:

Well it’s certainly a very interesting idea, but I don’t know if I would
ever stay there. I’m afraid we’ve run out of time, see you again next
week.
