Activity 2
In the dialogue Lisa says: You said you wanted it medium rare. This tells us what
Denise had said before.
Reported speech is used with a noun clause to report what someone has said. We do
not use quotation marks when we are reporting. For example:
Direct Speech: Marie said, “I walk to work every day.”
Reported Speech: Marie said (that) she walked to work every day.
To form reported speech we put the verb in the noun clause “one tense back.” For
example:

listen → listened
am listening → was listening
have listened → had listened
will listen → would listen
may listen → might listen
must listen → had to listen
should listen → should listen
Note: (the modals: should, ought to, could and might do not change to a past form)

Change these direct sentences into reported speech.
1. Don asked, “What are you talking about?”
Don asked me ……………………………………………………………………
2. Ronda said, “I might go to San Francisco for Christmas.”
Ronda said (that) …………………………………………………………………
3. Tamara said, “I am going to go to the cinema with Jonathan.”
Tamara told me (that) ……………………………………………………………….
4. Zara said, “I may go shopping.”
