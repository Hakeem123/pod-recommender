Title: “Red Power”
Summary:

Vanessa and Nick are interviewing Professor Russell Hill of Durham University who
speaks about the competitive advantage of teams and athletes wearing red.
In this episode of World Report, Vanessa and Nick are in the middle of a live show in a
radio studio. Nick is reporting live from Durham, UK. Professor Russell Hill of Durham
University also joins them. Listen to their conversation and answer the question that
follows about the main idea.
Dialogue:
Vanessa:

Hello and welcome to World Report. Nick has been talking
to Professor Russell Hill of Durham University in the UK,
whose research may come as a bit of a shock to those
of you who support any red-clad teams. Professor Hill,
thanks for joining us.

Russell:

My pleasure.

Vanessa:

What sports did your study cover?

Russell:

We chose four Olympic sports: boxing, taekwondo, GrecoRoman wrestling and freestyle wrestling. In all four,
athletes are randomly assigned red or blue. That made it
easier for us to track the existence of any pattern or
patterns.

Nick:

And how well did the reds do?

Russell:

In all four sports, reds triumphed in more contests. 62% of
them, in fact.

Nick:

That’s quite impressive. But what if your team colors are
anything except red? Does that put you at a disadvantage?

Russell:

Well, no, I wouldn’t go as far as that. If your team’s
good, then wearing black or green or whatever certainly
won’t set you back. And if your team’s no good, a red shirt
won’t stop you from losing.

Vanessa:

Professor, when was the red shirt an advantage?

Russell:

When the opponents were pretty much the same level of
performance. In contrast, when one side was obviously
better, the winning ratio was split between reds and blues.

Vanessa:

Is there a scientific explanation for this?

Russell:

Well, evolutionary psychologists speculate that the eyes of
primates may be particularly sensitive to red.

Nick:

So we’re talking about the animal world.

Russell:

Right. Similarly, in sports, humans may experience a
testosterone surge while wearing red. They will feel more
energetic, perhaps even more aggressive.

Nick:

On the other hand, when facing an opponent in red…

Russell:

…they’re likely to feel submissive, which may reduce
their chances of winning. However, it’s all a matter of
context, so one shouldn’t generalize.

Now answer the following question …
What’s the power of the color red in sports?
It seems to give those who wear it a competitive advantage

Now listen again to the dialogue in parts. After each part there will be 3 to 4 questions
on some details...

Now answer the following questions:

4

1. What does Vanessa mean when she says the professor’s research “may come
as a bit of a shock”?
When Vanessa says the professor’s research “may come as a bit of a
shock”, she means that you may find it surprising.
2. What does Russell mean when he says “in fact”?
When Russell says “in fact”, he means that he wants to clarify his point.
3. What does Russell mean when he says “I wouldn’t go as far as that”?
When Russell says “I wouldn’t go as far as that”, he means that he
doesn’t totally agree.

Now listen again to the second part of the dialogue.
Part 2
Vanessa:

Professor, when was the red shirt an advantage?

Russell:

When the opponents were pretty much the same level of
performance. In contrast, when one side was obviously
better, the winning ratio was split between reds and blues.

Nick:

On the other hand, when facing an opponent in red…

Russell:

…they’re likely to feel submissive, which may reduce
their chances of winning. However, it’s all a matter of
context, so one shouldn’t generalize.

Now answer some questions…
1. Why does Russell say “In contrast, when one side was obviously better, the
winning ratio was split between reds and blues”?
Russell says “In contrast”, because he wants to express the contrast
between two different winning cases.

5

2. Why does Russell say “Similarly, in sports, humans may experience a
testosterone surge while wearing red”?
Russell says “Similarly”, because he wants to point out that there is a
similarity in the behavior of primates and humans.
3. Why does Russell say “They’re likely to feel submissive”?
Russell says “They’re likely to feel submissive”, because he wants to
express the contrast between playing in red and facing an opponent in
red.

Primate (N.): A primate is a member of the most developed and intelligent group of
mammals, including humans, monkeys and apes.
Put at a disadvantage: If you are put at a disadvantage then your attempts to do
something are hindered or harmed. Set you back is the same.

Activity 2

A. Consider the following explanations.
Russell says “In contrast, when one side was obviously better, the winning ratio was
split between reds and blues.” A ratio can be expressed numerically as 1:4 and
pronounced ‘one in four’ or ‘a ratio of one to four’.
Fractions are expressed using ordinal numbers: a third, a quarter, a half, two fifths,
three-quarters, etc.

7

Decimals are expressed using the word point. Each figure is pronounced separately:

American English
British English

0.35

0.5

6.75

Zero point three
five
Naught point three
five
Oh point three five

Zero point five

Six point seven five

Naught point five
Oh point five

Six point seven five

B. Write these figures the way they are said.
1. 0.45
2. 1.85
3. 1/3
