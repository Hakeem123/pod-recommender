Title: “Snail Mail”
Summary:
Vanessa and Nick about the possibility for many post offices in the UK to be closed.

In this episode of World Report Vanessa and Nick are in the middle of a live show in a
radio studio. Nick is reporting live from London. Listen to their conversation and answer
the question that follows about the main idea.

Dialogue:
Vanessa:

Hello to all our listeners. Hi Nick. So what’s the scoop on snail mail?
Are there actually signs that it’s going the way of the dinosaur?

Nick:

Hi Vanessa. Yes, all the signs are that the familiar image of a postman in
uniform delivering mail in all kinds of weather may soon be history, at
least in many areas of Britain.

Vanessa:

Wait a minute. Is this official?

Nick:

Well, the spokesperson for the Department of Trade and Industry said
approximately 3,000 post offices may be closed in 2007 under costcutting plans. And some of the services they provide will now be taken
over by local shops.

Vanessa:

How was this received?

Nick:

It’s sparked a controversy. Some say this was to be expected; others feel
post offices, at least those in the rural areas, must be kept open to give
people access to essential services.

Vanessa:

Nick, you mentioned the government’s cost-cutting plans. So the
state-owned postal operator…

Nick:

That’s the Royal Mail…

Vanessa:

Uh-huh…

Nick:

…They’ve been competing with private enterprises since they lost their
350-year monopoly on postal services a year ago. Plus they lost key
business when the government started paying benefits like state pensions
directly through claimants’ bank accounts.

Vanessa:

Can you give us any figures?

Nick:

Yes, last year, the loss was two million pounds a week. This year it’s
expected to double.

Vanessa:

The widespread use of e-mail and texting on cell phones must have
dented profits!

Nick:

That’s certainly an explanation.

Vanessa:

Well, let’s face it. We live in an ever-changing world and it seems
there’s no going back: we’re forced to keep up with the times. Thanks
Nick.

Now answer the following question…
What is going to happen to the post offices in the U.K?
They are going to close

Now listen again to the dialogue in parts. After each part there will be 3 to 4 questions

GLOSSARY
Benefit: Benefit is a noun that means money that is paid by the state to an employee as
added financial help. For example, we talk about housing benefit, child benefit, health
benefit, unemployment benefit, etc.
Claimant: A claimant is a person who is entitled to something or has the right to receive
something. For example, we say “Pensions will be paid directly through the claimants’ bank
accounts.”
Dent: If you dent something, you make a hollow mark in its surface. For example, we say,
“I accidentally dropped a box from my balcony, and it dented the trunk of the car that was
parked right under it.” The verb dent is also used metaphorically to mean negatively affect
or damage. For example, in the radio broadcast you heard, “The widespread use of e-mail
and texting has also dented profits.”
Go the way of the dinosaur: Going the way of the dinosaur is an expression that
means expected to become extinct or obsolete. For example, when we say “Typewriters
have gone the way of the dinosaur,” we mean that they are obsolete.
History: To be history is a similar expression to ‘Go the way of the dinosaur’. When
something is history, it’s a thing of the past and it no longer exists. When we say, for
example, that the image of a postman may soon be history, we mean that it may soon
cease to exist.
Keep up with the times: The expression to keep up with the times (also move with
the times) means to change your ideas, opinions or way of living or working in order to
adjust to the modern way of doing things. For example, “The way technology keeps
developing is forcing us to keep up with the times.”
Snail mail: Snail mail is a noun used to refer to letters or messages sent by conventional
mail and not by e-mail.
Spark a controversy / debate: If something sparks a controversy or a debate, it
provokes a sudden reaction of the public and it divides their opinion: some people agree to it
and some people object to it. The verb spark means cause the start of something,
especially the start of a protest or an argument, and the noun controversy means
disagreement.
Spokesperson: A spokesperson is a person who is chosen to speak to the media on
behalf of the government, or an organization, or a company. This person makes public
announcements and answers journalists’ questions.

Texting: Texting is a noun referring to the process of sending a written message from one
cell phone or pager to another. It’s also called (text) messaging.

Activity 2

A. Study the following explanations:
1. If you ask ‘What’s the scoop on…’, you want to know some details or the latest
facts about it.
2. The question ‘Is this official?’ is asked when one wants to confirm that something
was actually announced by someone in authority. If you tell someone ‘It’s official’,
you mean it has been decided on or announced by people in authority.
3. The verb ‘receive’ is sometimes used in the passive voice to describe the way people
react to something. For example, if we say that a new film is well received, we mean
that it gets good reviews. The question ‘How was this received?’ means ‘How did the
public react to this?’ or ‘What did people think?’
4. Compound adjectives are adjectives made up of two or more words that are linked by
means of hyphens. The second word could be
 a present participle (a good-looking man, a fast-growing industry),
 a past participle (a well-mannered person, ready-made products), or
 a noun (a 350-year monopoly, an eight-storey building, a three-hour film).
5. Remember that when using a compound noun the second part of which is a noun, the
noun form is always singular: an eighteen-month lease (not an ‘eighteen-months
lease’), a four-page introduction (not a ‘four-pages introduction’).

listened to. Use expressions containing the words ‘official’, ‘receive’ and ‘scoop’ that are
