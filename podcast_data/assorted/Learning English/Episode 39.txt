Title: “Restaurant Business”
Summary:

Vanessa and Lisa discuss about how to be a successful restaurant owner.
In this episode of World Report Vanessa and Lisa are in the middle of a live show in
a radio studio. Listen to their conversation and answer the question that follows
about the main idea.
Dialogue:
VANESSA:

Owning a restaurant these days can be quite a profitable venture,
but sometimes it can turn out to be a total disaster. Lisa has some
appetizers for us.

LISA:

Restaurants are a make or break business. So you can either make it
big or lose the lot.

VANESSA:

What’s the secret to the restaurant success anyway Lisa?
Management, skillful chefs, set up? Or is it the “secret herbs and
spices” recipe?

LISA:

Obviously the culinary talent of the chef plays a significant role, but
management, decoration and set up are also contributing factors to a
thriving business.

VANESSA:

The thing is people always try to combine food with leisure, so dining
out seems quite appealing to all. It’s a rather social event I would say.

LISA:

That’s a fact Vanessa and that’s where all restauranteurs are putting
all their money, after choosing quality over quantity. A fancy little
patisserie, warm and friendly company, over an exquisite bottle of
vintage red wine! Can you think of a better night out?

VANESSA:

Mmm, sounds scrumptious! Honestly speaking though, the perfect
combo would be top notch food in a top notch joint.

LISA:

I know the perfect joint Vanessa, just around the corner. Wanna grab
some lunch?

VANESSA:

I’m all for it Lisa. Let’s go! Sorry folks but we’re ravenous. Bye for
now.

Bye and bon appetite!
