Vanessa:

It’s obvious that we all more or less feel stressed, but what are the
roots of stress Denise?

Well, stress is typically brought about by a situation where we feel
that there isn’t much we can do about it . . .

Vanessa:

Like when you go shopping and the store is crowded or when the
washing machine breaks down.

Denise:

Exactly! Even these little things can make somebody extremely
stressed.

Vanessa:

Oh tell me about it! I got so frustrated this morning when my
motorcycle didn’t start. I’ve still got a headache.

Denise:

Ah, now you see headaches and tiredness are the most common
symptoms of stress. And…

Vanessa:

Sorry to interrupt, but are there any other symptoms besides
tiredness and headaches?

Denise:

Another thing is if you get angry easily. . .

Vanessa:

Oh gosh! I do actually but I’m sure it’s not because I’m stressed out.

Denise:

Well, research has shown that if you get angry easily then you are
probably suffering from stress.

age thing - you know . . . nearing the ‘big three – oh’

productive!

‘roots’?
‘The roots’ means the causes. So Vanessa is asking what the causes of stress
are.
2. Denise says: “stress is typically brought about by a situation where we feel
that there isn’t much we can do about it . . .” What does ‘brought about’
mean?
‘Brought about’ means caused. So Denise is saying that the cause of stress is a
situation where we feel that there isn’t much we can do about it.
3. Vanessa says: “Oh tell me about it!” What does she mean?
We say ‘tell me about it!’ when we want to totally agree with what someone
said. So Vanessa wants to show Denise that she gets stressed by little things
too.
