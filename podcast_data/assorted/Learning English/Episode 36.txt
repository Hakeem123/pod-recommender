Summary:

radio studio. Listen to their conversation and answer the question that follows about
the main idea.

Dialogue:
Vanessa:

Cigarette smokers the world over are overjoyed, following a US courts’
decision to give the go-ahead to the largest class action lawsuit in
the US. You’re a smoker aren’t you, Denise? What do you think about
this?

Denise:

Well, Vanessa, I was but I quit at New Year. However, the tobacco
companies have been left literally “fuming” by this new case
Vanessa.

Vanessa:

Why is that?

Denise:

Well, to put it bluntly, if this lawsuit is won, they’ll be forced to fork
out literally millions of dollars in compensation. I think, it’s
common knowledge that tobacco companies have always tried to

rope in smokers with various…well, lets’ just say…”questionable
methods”. And now its time for “the smokers’ revenge”

tobacco companies would like it.

If only tobacco companies would adopt more ‘ethical practices’ in their
marketing strategies.

Easier said than done. We live in an age where the “almighty dollar”
rules.

I’ll second that!
