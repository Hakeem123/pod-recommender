Dialogue:
Vanessa:

Hello, and welcome to the Health Freaks show. Today we’re talking about
skateboarding… I’m sure that many of you think it’s a relatively new
sport, but Nick, did you know that skateboarding has been around since
the 50’s?

Nick:

Really? That long?

Vanessa:

Yep… it actually originated in California and became known as sidewalk
surfing.

Nick:

I guess it must have been similar to windsurfing

Vanessa:

Yeah, a lot… early skaters imitated surfing styles and moves to a large
extent.

Nick:

And what did they use back then as skateboards?

Vanessa:

The first skaters were pretty inventive! They used wooden
boxes or planks with roller skate wheels attached on them.

Nick:

Where there’s a will there’s a way! But how did things
change in the 60’s? I know that it really took off…

Vanessa:

Right, it became something of a craze. In fact it was so
popular that manufacturers started building skateboards and
they even put together teams to promote their early
skateboards.

Nick:

Wow! Sounds like skateboarding was becoming a big thing!

Vanessa:

Actually it became so big that in 1965 the international
championships were broadcast on national TV.

Nick:

Why are most people under the impression that
skateboarding took off in the 70’s, when commercial
skateboards hit the market?

Vanessa:

Probably because its popularity dropped in 1966 and remained
low until the early 70’s?

Nick:

You might be right!

Vanessa:

Or you might have probably associated its popularity with the
development of equipment specially designed for
skateboarding.

Nick:

Technological advances did their trick too!

Vanessa:

They certainly did! Otherwise skateboarding would just be
history.

1. What does Nick mean when he says: “That long?”
“That long” shows our surprise at how long something has been going on.
2. What does Nick mean when he says: “where there’s a will there’s a
way!”?
We use ‘Where there’s a will there’s a way” when we want to say that when we
really want to accomplish something, we’ll find a way to do it.
3. Nick says: “But how did things change in the 60’s? I know that it really took
off…”. What does take off mean?
Take off means to become popular and successful.

Now answer some questions…
1. Vanessa says: “it became something of a craze.” What does “craze” mean?
“Craze” is an activity that is unusually popular for a short time only.
2. Nick says: “Why are most people under the impression that skateboarding
took off in the 70’s?”. What does “under the impression” mean?
When someone is under the impression it means that he’s wrong to believe
something.
3. Nick says: “Technological advances did their trick too!” What does “did the
trick” mean?
When something does the trick, it helps you accomplish what you want or
need.

Activity 2

Read the following text about female skate boarders in which there are 7 errors in
the agreement between subjects and verbs. Can you correct the errors?
Skateboarding are a male-dominated sport; a survey in 2002 estimated that only 26
percent of skateboarders is female. In the early years of the sport, there was
relatively few female skaters; Peggy Oki, Ellen O'Neal, and Ellen Berryman was a few
who achieved fame in the 1970s. The skateboarding craze in the 1990s, together
with an overall advancement in women's sports, produced more female skaters than
in previous decades. Skaters such as Elisa Steamer and Cara-Beth Burnside took
women's skateboarding to a new level. This trend continued into the new millennium
with Amy Caron, Vanessa Torres, and Lyn-z Adams Hawkins. Presently, there is
skateboarding competitions for women at all major skateboarding events, such as
the X-games, the Gravity Games, and the Slam City Jam. There is many female-only
skate companies, sessions, and camps to help advance the female skateboarding
movement. There has been two major skate films focusing on female skaters Getting Nowhere Faster and AKA: Girl Skater.
