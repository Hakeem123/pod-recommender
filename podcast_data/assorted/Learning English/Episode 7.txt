Title: “Children’s Acquisition of Language”
Summary:

Lisa Keble, a language specialist explains to Alexander and Lisa how children acquire
language.
__________________________________________________________________
Alexander is in the middle of a live show in a radio studio. He is interviewing Lisa
Keble, a language specialist. Listen to their conversation and answer the question
that follows about the main idea.
Alexander:

Welcome back to Languages around the Globe Show. I’m Alexander
Smith and Lisa Keble is here with us again today to discuss
children’s acquisition of language. Just how many languages can
a child pick up until the age of three without getting confused?

Lisa:

Children can become fluent in as many as 7 languages provided that
significant people in their lives speak the target languages to them.
You see, it’s really important for children to associate each language
with a different person.

Alexander:

Well, family members qualify as significant people in children’s lives,
don’t they?

Lisa:

I sure hope so!

Alexander:

What other factors play a role in successfully acquiring a language?

Lisa:

I’ve seen that exposure to various languages through songs, movies,
and games, makes a world of difference.

Alexander:

Oh, I wish I’d grown up in a multi-cultural environment. I wouldn’t
have to struggle so much now with foreign languages.

Lisa:

Well, it’s always easier for kids! They are more at ease and not
really afraid of making mistakes. We, on the other hand, feel so selfconscious and are so terrified of losing face.

Alexander: I know exactly what you mean! I’ll never set foot in that restaurant
again after thanking the owner in my broken Italian for a dreadful
evening, instead of the delightful meal I had.

Now answer the following question . . .

What are Alexander and Lisa talking about?
They are talking about second language acquisition in children.

Now listen again to the dialogue in parts. After each part there will be 3 to 4
questions on the details...
Part 1
Alexander:

Welcome back to Languages around the Globe Show. I’m Alexander
Smith and Lisa Keble is here with us again today to discuss
children’s acquisition of language. Just how many languages can
a child pick up until the age of three without getting confused?

Lisa:

Children can become fluent in as many as seven languages provided
that significant people in their lives speak the target languages to
them. You see, it’s really important for children to associate each
language with a different person.

Alexander:

Well, family members qualify as significant people in children’s lives,
don’t they?

Lisa:

I sure hope so!

Now answer some questions…
1. Alexander says: “I’m Alexander Smith and Lisa Keble is here with us again
today to discuss children’s acquisition of language.” What does
“children’s acquisition of language” mean?
Children’s acquisition of language happens when children are beginning to
speak.
2. Alexander says: “Just how many languages can a child pick up by the age of
three without getting confused?” What does “pick up” mean?
To pick up a language means to learn a language.
3. Lisa says: “Children can become fluent in as many as seven languages.”
What does “fluent” mean?
When someone is fluent in any language it means that he can speak a
language well and without many pauses.
4. Lisa says: “it’s really important for children to associate each language with
a different person.” What does “associate” mean?
Associate means connect. So Lisa is trying to say that it is really important for
the children to connect each person with one language.

Now listen to the second part of the dialogue.
Part 2
Alexander:

What other factors play a role in successfully acquiring a language?

Lisa:

I’ve seen that exposure to various languages through songs, movies,
and games, makes a world of difference.

Alexander:

Oh, I wish I’d grown up in a multi-cultural environment. I wouldn’t
have to struggle so much now with foreign languages.

Lisa:

Well, it’s always easier for kids! They are more at ease and not
really afraid of making mistakes. We, on the other hand, feel so selfconscious and are so terrified of losing face.

Alexander: I know exactly what you mean! I’ll never set foot in that restaurant
again after thanking the owner in my broken Italian for a dreadful
evening instead of the delightful meal I had.

Now answer some questions…
1. Alexander says: “What other factors play a role in successfully acquiring a
language?” What does “play a role” mean?
To play a role means to help or to be part of the cause. So here Alexander
wants to know what else makes children learn a language.
2. Lisa says: “I’ve seen that exposure to various languages through songs,
movies, and games, makes a world of difference.” What does “make a
world of difference” mean?
To make a world of difference means to improve something very much. So
here Lisa is saying that when children listen to songs or watch movies in any
other language they learn that language more easily.
3. Lisa says:” They are more at ease and not really afraid of making mistakes.”
What does “at ease” mean?
At ease means more relaxed. So here Lisa is saying that children are more
relaxed and therefore they find it easier to learn a foreign language.
4. Alexander says: “I’ll never set foot in that restaurant again after thanking the
owner in my broken Italian for a dreadful evening instead of the delightful
meal I had.” What does “broken Italian” mean?
When you use the word broken to describe how you speak a language you
want to show that you can’t speak that language easily and that you have to
stop a lot to think.
