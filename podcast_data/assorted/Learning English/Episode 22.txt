Denise:

I know! We could also check out that new movie theatre then.

Lisa:

Are you talking about the one that has reclining seats?

Denise:

Yep, and did you know you can order a drink or even have a meal
while you’re watching the movie?

Lisa:

Get outta here! That sounds amazing! It’s a date then! And I’m
definitely gonna order a meal, cause I’ll be famished after a long day
at work.

Lisa:

I’m wondering though, with so much luxury isn’t it expensive?

Denise:

Well, to be honest, it is a bit steep, €20, but I really think it’s worth it.

Lisa:

Okay. Do you want me to get the tickets? I’m driving by there after
work today anyway.

Denise:

Yes, that would be great. The seating is limited. But if you don’t
have time, I think we can also buy the tickets on the Internet.
