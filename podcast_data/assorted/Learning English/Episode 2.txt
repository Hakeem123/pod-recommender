Hi there! We’re going back in time today to talk about one of the

guess while I welcome Nick to our program; hello Nick – thanks for

your quiz.

Let’s give them the answer then. Today we’re talking about beer, the
history of beer. So Nick how popular was beer in ancient times?

Well, it was quite popular until wine became more easily available.

Vanessa:

When was beer first brewed?

Nick:

According to historians in 10,000 BC beer was already being brewed
by ancient Mesopotamians and Sumerians. Likewise, the ancient
Egyptians and Chinese brewed beer.

Vanessa:

How similar was it to today’s beer?

Nick:

Well, firstly the product was probably different from today’s bottled
varieties. Another thing is that in many cases corn was used instead
of barley. But the interesting thing is that women were the master
brewers at the time not men!

Vanessa:

You’re joking?!

Nick:

No, seriously; and in ancient Babylon women brewers were also
priestesses.

Vanessa:

But beer had its bad moments as well, didn’t it?

Nick:

Yes, it did. In America in the 1920s, despite its popularity, beer was
prohibited; of course not everyone stopped drinking but many

breweries went out of business and the only production of beer
was made by gangster-controlled operations.

Vanessa:

I suppose they were not known for their high-quality products. So,
when was beer legalized again?

production took over.

sentence to show that you are adding something to the previous point.

making beer. We use ‘you’re joking!’ to emphasize that what somebody said is very
surprising.
3. Nick says: “In America in the 1920s, despite its popularity, beer was prohibited.”

business’ mean?

will have to rent a car and a room which cost a lot. Ok it’s near the sea but I don’t
like swimming that much anyway.

happy life than to worry about your appearance.
