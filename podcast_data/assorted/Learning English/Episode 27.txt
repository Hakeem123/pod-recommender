Didn’t you tell him that you’re a vegan?

Vanessa:

The fact that I’m a vegan didn’t seem to make a
difference…he just kept on raving about how the restaurant is
renowned for it’s meat and insisted I try it.

Denise:

Then what happened?

Vanessa:

Well, he had no table manners whatsoever. He chewed with
his mouth open and talked constantly about himself.

Denise:

How gross!!!

Vanessa:

I just couldn’t stand it anymore! I told him I had a terrible
headache and really needed to go home.

Denise:

So, did he buy it?

Vanessa:

Yeah, he believed me! But, said he wasn’t ready to leave and
told me there was a taxi stand outside.

Denise:

I can’t believe it!

Vanessa:

Oh, believe it! And as I was about to storm out, he had the
audacity to ask me to leave money for my share of the food.

Denise:

Did you?
