Title: “Imperfect Escapes”
Summary:

Vanessa and reporter Michael Mathews discuss the ecological damage in Dubai.
In this episode of World Report Vanessa and Michael are in the middle of a live show in
a radio studio. Michael is reporting live from the coast of Dubai in the Persian Gulf.
Frederic Launay, director of WWF’s office in Dubai, also joins them. Listen to their
conversation and answer the question that follows about the main idea.
Dialogue:
Vanessa:

Our reporter, Michael Mathews is looking down on the
world today while sipping on his coffee. And no, he’s not in
space. Clueless? Michael, over to you.

Michael:

Thanks Vanessa. ‘The World’ is a group of 300 man-made
islands taking shape along Dubai’s coastline. When the
project is over and done with, they will look just like a map
of the world from above.

Vanessa:

So the name’s quite apt.

Michael:

I’ll say.

Vanessa:

Are they for sale?

Michael:

For sale or for rent, they’re being advertised as the perfect
place for VIPs to escape to. They’re expected to boost
Dubai’s already thriving tourism and will help them to
prepare for when the low oil reserves in the region run
out.…

Vanessa:

But?

Michael:

The construction work is impacting on the local ecosystem.

Vanessa:

I thought that was coming…

Michael:

Frederic Launay, director of WWF’s office in Dubai is with
us to explain. Frederic, thanks for being with us. Now,
there’s a blaze of publicity surrounding the attractive
aspect of these islands…

Frederic:

Well, exactly. If only the media would focus on the
less glamorous side. These developments have taken a
heavy toll on the local ecosystem. Just to give you an idea,
the only known coral reef off the Dubai shores has been
destroyed, and which has meant that sea turtle nesting
sites have been eliminated.

Michael:

Who’s funding this project?

Frederic:

State-owned property developer Nakheel. Despite our
appeals, they only keep assuring us they’ll use
revolutionary techniques to stimulate coral growth.

Vanessa:

Would that work?

Frederic:

Possibly. The media could help by raising awareness
of the environmental issues, but as it is, I’m sorry
to say, they aren’t helping much.

Vanessa:

A massive project underway in Dubai, but what a high
price to pay.

Now answer the following question…
What is the problem with the Dubai construction project?
It is damaging the local ecosystem.

Now listen again to the dialogue in parts. After each part there will be 3 to 4 questions
on some details...

GLOSSARY
Appeal: Commenting on the reaction on the part of the property developer Nakheel,
Frederic Launay also said that despite WWF’s appeals, all Nakheel has done is keep
assuring them that they will use revolutionary techniques to stimulate coral growth.
When a person or an organization appeals to the public – often on TV – for a certain
person, they make an urgent request for something (e.g. money). Individuals or groups
of people make an appeal for calm, for donations, etc.
Apt: Vanessa commented that the name of the island group (‘the World’) was quite
apt, meaning that it was quite suitable or appropriate. If someone describes a name, a
comment or a description as apt, they mean that the name, comment or description is
appropriate in the circumstances -- it’s aptly named or described.
Blaze of publicity: Michael pointed out that there’s a blaze of publicity surrounding
the attractive aspect of the World Islands. What he meant was that there’s a great deal
of attention given by the media to the attractive aspect of these islands. We sometimes
describe the publicity surrounding something as good, or bad, or adverse (=bad or
negative). A blaze of publicity is a lot of publicity.
Boost: You heard that the island construction project is expected to boost Dubai’s
tourism. This means that Dubai’s tourism is expected to grow further. A government
takes measures to boost exports, tourism, etc. or a corporation tries to boost sales,
profits, etc. they try to improve or increase sales, profits, etc.
Impact on: Michael said that the construction work is impacting on the local
ecosystem. This means that the project is affecting the local ecosystem. Human activity
is often said to have a negative impact on the environment. A negative (or positive)
impact on something is a negative (or positive) effect on something.
Over and done with: Michael said that when the project is over and done with, the
group of islands along Dubai’s coastline will look just like a map of the world. If
something is over and done with, it’s completely finished.
Take a heavy toll on: Frederic Launay said that the media were focusing on the
glamorous aspect of this project, failing to mention that the construction developments
have taken a heavy toll on the local ecosystem. A toll is money that a motorist has
to pay in order to use a particular road or highway (a toll road). In a metaphorical
sense, when someone talks about the death toll having reached 240, they refer to the
number of casualties (dead and injured people). The expression to take a heavy toll
on something means to damage something greatly. For example, working too hard can
take its toll or a heavy toll on a person’s health.
Thrive: Michael described Dubai’s tourism as already thriving. If a business, a
country’s economy, its trade, or its tourism thrives, it flourishes, it prospers. If your
garden thrives, the plants in it grow strong and healthy.
