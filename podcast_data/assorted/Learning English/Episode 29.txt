Lisa:

A matrioshka! One of those Russian dolls that fit into each other…
anyway, as soon as she saw that she started reciting a Russian
poem.

Alexander:

How on earth would she know a Russian poem?

Lisa:

Her babysitter is Russian and she sometimes sings or reads to her in
Russian. So, I guess Nefeli’s picking up Russian was inevitable.
