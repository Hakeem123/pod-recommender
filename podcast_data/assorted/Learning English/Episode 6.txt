Vanessa and Michael are in the middle of a live show in a radio studio. Listen to
their conversation and answer the question that follows about the main idea.
Dialogue:
Vanessa:

I’m sure we’ve all been in a situation where a mosquito’s driven us
crazy. In today’s program Michael will tell us more about these little
monsters and their annoying habits.

Michael:

Hi Vanessa.

Vanessa:

Nice to have you here, Michael. So, what brings mosquitoes to our
homes?

Michael:

Well, firstly I should tell you that there are over 2500 different species
of mosquitoes throughout the world.

Vanessa:

No wonder we can’t get away from them in the summer.

Michael:

Too true! Now, the mosquitoes we find in the cities are the northern
house variety.

Vanessa:

A ‘northern house mosquito’?!

Michael:

Yes; they prefer to attack after dark and they usually live only a few
weeks during the warm summer months.

Vanessa:

So… what? They find food and warmth in our houses?

Michael:

Not only that! It’s also a place for them to lay their eggs.

Vanessa:

How many eggs are we talking about?

Michael:

A single female can lay over 200 eggs at a time.

Vanessa:

Yuch!

Michael:

. . . and they can survive for five years. Mind you – it’s only the females that
bite.

Vanessa:

In other words, the female mosquitoes are the blood suckers!?

Michael:

Right!

Vanessa:

So how can we tell male mosquitoes from female ones?

Michael:

Research shows that females have smaller and less sensitive antennae
than males but you certainly can’t tell the difference with the
naked eye.

Vanessa:

Is their buzz different at all?

Michael:

Not that I know of; but it plays an important role in mating.

Vanessa:

What do you mean?

Michael:

In a nutshell, their eyesight is so poor that it’s the only way they can
find each other. A female mosquito listens out for the buzz of a male
and vice-versa.

Vanessa:

So that annoying noise is the sound of mosquitoes flirting!

Michael:

That’s it. And they continue until their buzzes are in harmony.

Vanessa:

Amazing! Michael, thank you so much for being here!

Now answer the following question . . .
What are Vanessa and Michael talking about?
They’re talking about the characteristics of northern house mosquito and the
differences between male and female mosquito.

Now listen again to the dialogue in parts. After each part there will be 3 to 4
questions on the details...

Now answer some questions . . .
1. Vanessa says: “No wonder we can’t get away from them in the summer”. What
does ‘no wonder’ mean?
‘No wonder’ means ‘it is not surprising’. Vanessa emphasizes that there are so many
mosquitoes that it’s not surprising we can’t escape from them in the summer.
2. Michael says: “. . . and they can survive for five years. Mind you – it’s only the
females that bite.” Why does Michael say ‘mind you’?

Michael wants to emphasize the point he adds about female mosquitoes. We use
‘mind you’ in spoken English to add something that makes the previous point less
strong.
3. Vanessa says: “In other words, the female mosquitoes are the blood suckers!?”
Why does Vanessa use ‘in other words’?
Vanessa uses ‘in other words’ to give an explanation to the point made by Michael.
We use ‘in other words’ in spoken and written English to introduce an explanation of
something.

Now listen again to the dialogue in parts. After each part there will be 3 to 4
questions on some details...

Vanessa:

Now answer some questions . . .
1. Vanessa says: “So Michael, how can we tell male mosquitoes from female
ones?” What does Vanessa want to know?
Vanessa wants to know how somebody can understand which mosquito is male and
which female. The expression ‘tell A from B’ is used in spoken English and it means
to be able to see the difference between two things or people.
2. Michael says: “. . . females have smaller and less sensitive antennae than males
but you certainly can’t tell the difference with the naked eye”. What does
‘you can’t tell the difference with the naked eye’ mean?

Learning English Podcasts: Lesson 6

It means that you can’t see the difference between two things without close
examination. So, Michael makes it clear that we can’t see that female mosquitoes
have smaller antennae than male mosquitoes just by looking at them.
3. Vanessa says: “Is their buzz different at all?” What does ‘at all’ mean?
‘At all’ means in any way. So, Vanessa wants to know if the noise male and female
mosquitoes make is different in any way.
4. Michael says: “In a nutshell, their eyesight is so poor that it’s the only way they
can find each other.” What does ‘In a nutshell’ mean?
‘In a nutshell’ is used when we want to say something complicated in a few words so
that it is easily understood.
