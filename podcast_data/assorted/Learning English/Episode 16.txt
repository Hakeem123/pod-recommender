One and the same!

Vanessa:

I never thought I’d live to see that … hip hop going mainstream!

Alexander:

Exactly! How many of you know that hip hop got its start in the 70s,

And MCs at concerts started speaking to audiences to this beat.
Actually that was right here in N.Y, in the Bronx.

So the MCs invented hip-hop!

Alexander:

You bet they did! Musicians just set it to music.

Vanessa:

Well, hip hop may be popular today but it’s considered controversial.

and drugs.

Alexander:

One and the same!

accepted hip hop as a significant form of music.” What does “accept” mean?

as a form of music.
2. Alexander says: “..they’ve decided they are going to fund the Smithsonian to
create a hip-hop exhibition.” What does “fund” mean?
“to fund” means to provide the money. The US Government will provide the
money for the creation of the hip-hop exhibition.
3. Alexander says: “One and the same!” What does he mean when he says
“one and the same”?
Alexander wants to emphasize that it is the same museum and not any other.
