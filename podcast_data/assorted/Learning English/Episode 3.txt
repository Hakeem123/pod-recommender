___________________________________________________________

In this broadcast, Vanessa is the middle of a live show interviewing Dr Laura Koram
about her research. Listen to their conversation and answer the question that follows
about the main idea.
Dialogue:
Vanessa:

Good afternoon. Do you find yourself buying things you don’t need?
Well, I’m joined in the studio by Dr Laura Koram, a researcher with
the Carolina institute of psychology, and publisher of a new report
about compulsive shopping. Dr Koram, thank you for being here.

Dr Koram:

My pleasure.

Vanessa:

So Dr Koram, what’s the deal?

Dr Koram:

Well, 1 in 20 American adults buy things they may not even want or
never need or use….

Vanessa:

No real surprise there. Though honestly, I’m surprised the number’s
so low.

Dr Koram:

umm…quite…, but what may raise an eyebrow or two is our
finding that men are just as likely as women to suffer from
“compulsive buying”.

Vanessa:

You’re kidding? Now that is a surprise. That means the days of
dragging my bored husband around a shopping mall are over.

Dr Koram:

um, yes, indeed. Our research has revealed that men are now just as
avid and compulsive shoppers as...Um…women.

Vanessa:

I gotta level with you doc, I always thought of compulsive buying
as very much a "woman's disease”.

Dr Koram:

Well yes, but our research shows that the number of men who
indulge in unnecessary ‘shopping therapy’ has dramatically increased
in the last ten years.

Vanessa:

So what’s changed? Where did all these male shopaholics come
from?

Dr. Koram:

I think that in the past male obsessive shoppers were more reluctant
than women to recognize that they have a problem and then come
forward and admit it. Generally, in psychiatry, men seek care less
often than women…It's not 'manly' to seek help.

Vanessa:

So what do you do? I mean, if you suspect your boyfriend of being a
non stop shopper?

Dr Koram:

It's always important to encourage people who have these types of
disorders to seek treatment. Many find themselves in debt and filled
with shame and can even experience suicidal tendencies as they
attempt to hide their addiction.

Vanessa:

Well, doc, thanks for letting us girls know about the dark side of male
shopping.

Dr Koram:

You’re welcome.

Now answer the following question . . .
What does the doctor’s research show?
That men are just as likely to be addicted to shopping as women.

Now listen again to the dialogue in parts. After each part there will be 3 to 4
questions on some details . . .
