Title: “Like Master Like Dog”
Summary:

Vanessa and Denise discuss about personality similarities between dogs and their
owners.
In this episode of World Report, Vanessa talks to Denise, who reports live from
Cincinnati, Ohio. Barbara Boat, director of the Childhood Trust at the University of
Cincinnati, also joins them. Listen to their conversation and answer the question that
follows about the main idea.
Dialogue:
Vanessa:

Welcome to World Report and hello to Denise in Ohio. Denise, what’s this
new study all about?

Denise:

Hi Vanessa. A study of 355 dog owners here in Ohio showed that owners
of vicious dogs such as pit bulls, rottweilers or chows had all had at
least one brush with the law.

Vanessa:

What! Each and every owner?

Denise:
Vanessa:
Denise:

Vanessa:

That’s right. And 30 % of people who failed to register them had at least
5 criminal convictions.
Criminal convictions?
For instance, domestic violence or drug trafficking.

Amazing. What about the owners of gentler dog breeds?

Denise:

Ah, now, only 1 % of owners of licensed and ‘gentler’ dogs, you know,
like terriers, collies, poodles, had any past convictions.

Vanessa:

That’s a world of difference, Denise, what are the implications of this
study?

Denise:

Well, I’m sure Barbara Boat, director of the Childhood Trust at the
University of Cincinnati, will have more to say on that. Thanks for joining
us.

Barbara:

My pleasure. Owners of vicious dogs are obviously more likely to
break the law. In fact, those who failed to register them are 3 times
more likely to have been convicted of domestic violence and 8 times
more likely to have been charged with drug crimes than owners of
gentler dogs.

Denise:

That’s remarkable.

Barbara:

It is. So in all probability, choosing to own a vicious dog is a marker of
social deviance.

Denise:

How do you think these findings might be useful in the future?

Barbara:

The chances are that social and law enforcement workers will use them
as a basis for further research.

Now answer the following question…
What does the recent study suggest about the owners of violent dogs?
They are more likely to be law breakers.

Now listen again to the dialogue in parts. After each part there will be 3 to 4 questions
on some details...

Now answer some questions…
1. What was Denise giving an example of when she said “such as pit bulls,
rottweilers or chows…”
When Denise said “such as pit bulls, rottweilers or chows…” she was giving an
example of vicious dogs.
2. What was Denise giving an example of when she said “like terriers, collies and
poodles…”
When Denise said “like terriers, collies and poodles…”she was giving an example
of gentler dogs.
3. What was Denise giving an example of when she said “for instance domestic
violence or drug trafficking.”
When Denise said “for instance domestic violence or drug trafficking” she was
giving an example of criminal convictions.

Now listen to the second part of the dialogue…

them as a basis for further research.

Now answer some questions…
1. What did Barbara mean when she said “… are obviously more likely to break
the law”?
When Barbara said “they are obviously more likely to break the law.” she wanted
to express certainty that vicious dog owners are more likely to break the law
than owners of gentler dog breeds
2. What did Barbara mean when she said “In all probability, choosing to own a vicious
dog is a marker of social deviance”?
When Barbara said “In all probability” she meant most likely.
3. What did Barbara mean when she said “The chances are that social and law
enforcement workers will use them as a basis for further research”?
When Barbara said “The chances are” she meant that it’s most likely.

GLOSSARY
A brush with: A brush with someone is an expected and unpleasant encounter with
someone. If you have a brush with the law, you have an unpleasant experience
because you broke the law on one occasion.
Charged with: If someone is charged with an offence, he or she is officially accused
of an offence. A criminal charge is an official accusation of a crime.
Convicted of: If someone is convicted of a crime, he or she is found guilty of a crime
in a court of law. The noun is conviction. ‘Having at least five criminal convictions’
means having been convicted on five different occasions.
Domestic violence: Domestic violence is violence between members of the same
family.
Drug trafficking: If you traffic in drugs, you trade in drugs. Drug trafficking is the
illegal trade of drugs.
Fail to register: In the report you heard that owners of vicious dogs who failed to
register them are three times more likely to have been charged with certain crimes.
If you fail to do something, you don’t do something that you are supposed to do.
Implications: The implications of an event, an action or a decision are the effects or
impact that this event, action or decision will have on people or things in the future.
Social deviance: The noun social deviance is used to refer to any kind of behaviour
that is considered abnormal or unacceptable by most people – deviant behaviour.
A world of difference: The expression a world of difference means a huge
difference. If there’s a world of difference between two things, they are poles
apart. If something makes a world of difference, it improves a situation greatly.
