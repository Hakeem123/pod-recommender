Lia: Hello, this is Lia Haddock, with me is my producer, Mark Green.

Mark: Hello.

Lia: Let’s talk through this.

Mark: Okay.

Lia: You got the first email when?

Mark: We got it five days ago to the general contact address on our website. The subject heading was: Answers. In all caps. ANSWERS. The body simply read: “NDC, NDC.” And attached was an encrypted file we didn’t know what to do with, and a photo.

Lia: …of Oscar Totem, in Limetown.

Mark: In a party hat, holding a wine bottle outside the doors of the research facility. [chuckles] Yeah. [0:34]

Lia: It’s one we hadn’t seen before.

Mark: Exactly. So suddenly this was very important to understand.

Lia: And that’s when Dan was brought in.

Mark: Right. Dan is a friend of one of our interns that – well, he knows about encryption.

Lia: Right.

Mark: And after several hours of stuff I don’t understand, Dan was able to open the file. It was an audio clip.

Computerized female voice: This is for Lia Haddock. I have all the answers about Limetown. [joined by Lia] Please respond.

Mark: So we did, immediately: Who is this, and how do we make this happen?! [1:06]

Lia: And the reply was…

Computerized female voice: Lia, are these answers the most important thing to you?

Mark: To which you responded…

Lia: Yes. But, also, how do we know this is real?

Mark: …Which I regret you asking.

[audio clip begins playing]

Gail: Why is the light flashing…?

Aaron: I don’t know, I’m trying to turn it off.

Gail: They’re going to see us –

Aaron: I’m working on it! Does-does the phone work? [1:30]

Gail: Where the hell do they all come from--?

Aaron: That doesn’t matter right now. Does. The phone. Work?

Gail: [deep breath, relieved] Oh, thank god… [phone dialing 911]

[sound of something being broken down]

Aaron: Shit! Uh… uh…

Gail: ##If they?## break through the outside door, you have to cut it off now… Cut it off right now!

Aaron: I know, I know!

[more sounds of something being broken down]

Gail: [speaking into phone] Hello, can you hear me?! We need emergency services in Limetown, [groans as banging continues] ambulances, police, firemen – damnit, just send the whole fucking army! [hyperventilates]

[Aaron’s voice muffled against sound of banging]

Gail: Cut it off!! Cut! It! Off! [2:03]

Aaron: Oh, no.

[strange whooshing sound]

[audio clip ends]

Lia: The next correspondence we received was a series of conditions for our interview with the person sending us these messages. Most notably among these conditions is that we are to broadcast the conversation live – something that management here at APR has reluctantly agreed to because of the, um, nature of the evidence being given to us. I’m not allowed to say much more beyond that at this time. You will, I hope, hear that conversation Monday.
